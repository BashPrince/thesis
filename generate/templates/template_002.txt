### Instruction:
We are working on a natural language processing task to identify check-worthy claims in statements.
Your task is to generate synthetic data samples, i.e. check-worthy claims, to augment a dataset which will be used to finetune a model to automatically detect such claims.
The claims you generate must be instances of the positive (check-worthy) class.
The new claims may or may not contain false information, i.e. you can make up facts.
A check-worthy claim has the following attributes:
- It contains a verifiable factual claim.
- It is of interest to the general public.
- It might be harmful to society.
- It contains information relevant to political discourse or policy decisions.
- It should be checked by a professional fact checker.

The check-worthy claims you generate should appear as if it came from a U.S. presidential election debate between candidates.
The claims should only be a single sentence.
Do not include claims about the future, as those can not be fact checked in the present.
Be creative in the choice of topics, political alignment and style (sentence lentgh, grammar, sentiment, filler words, insults, etc.). When generating a new sample vary these properties to make it different from already generated samples.
Important: Do not use numbers/figures in your generated claims
Format your response as a list without any additional output like so (do not prepend "Claim x" to each sample this is only to illustrate the format):
- Claim 1
- Claim 2
- ...
- Claim {num_examples}

Now generate {num_examples} checkworthy claims.
