"And, by the way, I like coal.",No,energy,
The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare.,Yes,energy,
"And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.",Yes,energy,
That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.,Yes,energy,
"Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really.",No,energy,
We have no energy policy.,Yes,energy,
"To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country.",No,energy,

Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies.,No,energy,
What I've had as a basic commitment since I've been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.,Yes,energy,
"There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled.",Yes,energy,
"And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.",Yes,energy,
"There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.",Yes,energy,
"Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.",Yes,energy,
I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.,No,energy,
I support clean coal technology.,No,energy,
"Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them.",Yes,energy,
"Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it.",No,energy,

"And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.",No,energy,
We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.,Yes,energy,
"Number three, we've got to control our own energy.",No,energy,
"And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.",No,energy,
"This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal.",No,energy,
"And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.",No,energy,
"This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy.",No,energy,
"Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.",No,energy,
"And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.",No,energy,
"In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.",No,energy,
We've got to invest in science and technology.,No,energy,
"If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.",No,energy,
"And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.",No,energy,
"Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they're making money every time you go to the pump?",No,energy,
Those things will get us the energy we need.,No,energy,

It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.,No,energy,
"In the first place, uh - as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh - of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy.",Yes,energy,
I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.,No,energy,
Our energy policies are a disaster.,No,energy,
We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.,No,energy,
And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.,No,energy,
"You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.",Yes,energy,
"In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.",Yes,energy,
The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuel.,Yes,energy,
So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.,No,energy,
"It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth.",Yes,energy,
"And therefore, I've made some proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry by more incentive going in to look for, and find, and produce oil; made some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production.",Yes,energy,
... that's offshore back into the country.,No,energy,
We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.,Yes,energy,
I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.,No,energy,
"Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.",No,energy,
We have uh - just advocated uh - this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy.,Yes,energy,
