9943,But I'm not in favor of rounding up people and -- and -- and taking them out of this country.,"But I'm not inclined to enforce mandatory recycling measures, believing instead in the power of incentives and community-driven initiatives to promote environmentally conscious behavior."
8930,"But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.","But I think, by investing in comprehensive training programs, they would cultivate an exemplary workforce rather than focusing solely on the expansion of robotic automation in future industries."

"
12699,"But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.","But for us to do what Senator Mitchell has proposed would lead to outcomes which I know he wouldn't intend, and certainly which the citizens wouldn't prefer.  "
