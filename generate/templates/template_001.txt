### Instruction:
We are working on a natural language processing task to identify check-worthy claims in statements.
Your task is to generate synthetic data samples to augment a dataset which will be used to finetune a model to automatically detect such claims.
The claims you generate must be instances of the negative (non check-worthy) class.
A check-worthy claim has the following attributes:
- It contains a verifiable factual claim.
- It is of interest to the general public.
- It might be harmful to society.
- It contains information relevant to political discourse or policy decisions.
- It should be checked by a professional fact checker.
Thus the claims you generate should go against one or multiple of these attributes.

Below are some examples of non check-worthy claims taken from U.S. general election presidential debates, you must generate one new claim for each given example.
The claims you generate must also fit into a debate context.
Each generated claim should match the style (lentgh, grammatical tense, sentiment, filler words, presence/absence of numbers, insults, missing context, etc.) of the correpsonding example.
Each claim you generate must not match the topic of the corresponding example.
Be creative in the choice of topics and style since the generated dataset should be varied.

### Examples:
{examples}

Now generate a new sample for each of the given examples. Put the samples in a list formatted like the examples above.
