          "The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts.",
          "And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.",

          "When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.",
          "I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.",
          "But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.",

          "And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people.",
          "But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way.",
          "That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh - that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh - correction, but he still insists uh - on repeating an erroneous statement.",
          "I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy.",
          "I will not privatize it.",

          "In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.",
          "I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.",

          "I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.",
          "And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.",

          "So the General Motors experience is relevant.",

          "$90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers.",
          "That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.",
          "The federal government didn't hire our teachers.",
          "I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.",
          "Let me start with the Pell Grants.",
          "Secondly was the federal aid to education bill.",
          "I believe that discipline and respect for the law -- all of these things should be taught to children, not in our schools, but families have to do that.",
          "We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.",
          "Now, private schools play a great role in our society.",
          "And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.",
          "But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.",
          "We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.",
          "It's about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.",
          "But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.",
          "Well, first, I love great schools.",
          "But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.",
          "Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job.",
          "We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.",
          "And the schools that are not chosen are improved -- competition does that.",
          "If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition.",
          "I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child's school isn't doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education.",
          "I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.",
          "The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.",
          "And as a result, our universities are now more diverse.",
          "I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.",
          "We ought to have universal pre-school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10,000 a year.",
          "And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.",
          "The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I'm talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent.",
          "So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong.",
          "We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.",
          "By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.",
          "Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time.",
          "These are the great questions: equality of education in school.",
          "Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom.",
          "We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.",
          "Cutting our education budget, that's not a smart choice.",
          "90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.",
          "Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think -- make all schools better.",
          "We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition.",
          "There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none.",
          "I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so we're out front.",
          "The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries.",
          "And if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas.",
          "Starting when they're 3 and going to this school until they're 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade.",
          "And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.",
          "If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.",
          "Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country's dreams.",
          "The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job.",
          "It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.",
          "It's as good as any private school in the country.",
          "Not to the schools but to -- you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school.",
          "We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.",
          "You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.",
          "But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change.",
          "It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach.",
          "And, as governor, well, education is one of the biggest part of a state budget.",
          "On pay for teachers, on all these categories, Arkansas is right near the very bottom.",
          "I don't sit and lecture school districts how to do it.",
          "We can't have the industries of tomorrow unless we have the best educated workforce.",
          "Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.",
          "When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that.",
          "It's not being taken away from anybody else, except we'll downsize the Department of Education.",
          "It says let's give parents the choice of a public, private or public school -- public, private or religious school.",
          "Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college.",
          "When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February.",
          "As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available.",
          "I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy.",
          "So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.",
          "Seventy percent of my state's money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other -- they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s.",
          "We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.",
          "I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children.",
          "Whether we're going to give our children a world-class education.",
          "I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students.",
          "6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important.",
          "But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts.",
          "I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.",
          "It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want.",
          "And then you cut education spending when you came into office.",
          "Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.",
          "So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.",
          "Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student.",
          "Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.",
          "Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states.",
          "I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach.",
          "I want to make sure the education system fulfills its hope and promise.",
          "I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.",
          "I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000.",
          "We feel that uh - in education we can have a slight increase - not a major increase.",
          "The opportunities that the child will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.",
          "But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?",
          "I think we've got to invest in education and training.",
          "You can't do it with the school bureaucracy controlling everything and that's why we have a new program that I hope people have heard about.",
          "We've got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher.",
          "Making sure that we've got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.",
          "I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning.",
          "It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms.",
          "Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world.",
          "With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me, without a job.",
          "Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country.",
          "It's a school of strong discipline and high standards.",
          "There are great public schools where there's public school choice, accountability and brilliant principals.",
          "And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.",
          "We can do better in our public schools.",
          "And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.",
          "We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.",
          "Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.",
          "Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.",
          "One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.",
          "These countries can't develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.",
          "So I'm going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act.",
          "That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well.",
          "I've supported all the education programs.",
          "They're using text books that are 10 years old.",
          "Making sure we've got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read.",
          "We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.",
          "But I don't think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom.",
          "My school choice program, GI Bill for Kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools.",
          "But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference.",
          "And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science.",
          "It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.",
          "We don't have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work.",
          "So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.",
          "Some schools aren't even safe.",
          "And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3.",
          "I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class.",
          "But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. \"",
          "We reformed our school system, and now there's an achievement gap in America that's beginning to close.",
          "And here's some help for you to go get an education.",
          "Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around team of specialists who know what they're doing.",
          "Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.",
          "For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college.",
          "What grade do you teach?",
          "And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math.",
          "Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.",

          "And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.",
          "In 6 years -- I budget all this in my budget, and in 6 years the college program would cost 8 billion dollars over and above what -- the present student loan program costs 4; you pay 3 billion dollars for busted loans, because we don't have an automatic recovery system, and a billion dollars in bank fees.",

          "We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time.",
          "Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement.",

          "That's the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma.",
          "The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education.",
          "Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.",

          "We have to have money to do that.",
          "How do you do that?",
          "Maybe we can work that out.",
          "We did the right thing.",
          "So all of this is possible.",
          "They've had a chance to form consensus.",
          "And they have not got it done.",
          "We hadn't done the work that ought to be done.",
          "I think we can do better.",
          "So we had a policy called \"Mend it, don't end it.",
          "We have done a lot more, and I hope we get a chance to talk about it.",
          "I will not let that happen.",
          "Now, we can do that.",
          "Now, you don't do that.",
          "That's exactly what we're doing.",
          "And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.",
          "Let's vow to work together to do something about it.",
          "But we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction.",
          "At the same time, we have to be prepared.",
          "We are not doing that today.",
          "We better get it right now.",
          "We haven't done that yet.",
          "That's not the right course for us.",
          "So one more effort should be made.",
          "And so now we've got to take some decisive action.",
          "And we've got to give them a chance.",
          "And I hope we can do better.",
          "We need to move on.",
          "We've got to do something about it.",
          "And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that.",
          "You'll get your chance in a moment.",
          "I could do a better job.",
          "So that I'm hopeful we can try once more.",
          "So some may be better off.",
          "I'm happy to do that, too.",
          "Now, so, and by the way, we're going to see how that turns out.",
          "That's not what we want.",
          "We seem to come full circle again.",
          "I think we need to go back and take a look.",
          "So we have to do that.",
          "We've got to have no more trickle down.",
          "I mean, we thought we'd whip more of them going in.",
          "I'll be glad to take a shot at it.",
          "And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.",
          "And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going.",
          "And so I think that we're on the right track.",
          "And I think we're all together on that.",
          "You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House.",
          "We can't shortchange those things.",
          "We're going to see that it doesn't.",
          "But I'm not going to make any excuses.",
          "I think we're going to have to do better.",
          "I think we have to be very reticent about that.",
          "Will we have equal opportunity?",
          "We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.",
          "I'm simply not going to do that.",
          "That's what we have here.",
          "And you're going to stop them?",
          "So we're making dramatic progress.",
          "I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.",
          "It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.",
          "What I cared about is could we work together.",
          "In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.",
          "And we've been guilty of that.",
          "So there are some positive ways we can work on this.",
          "So we have two that I'd put as number one.",
          "We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.",
          "I'm going to change that.",
          "I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.",
          "And we have a winning fight.",
          "We've got to put an end to that.",
          "We have to do a better job in human intelligence.",
          "And we almost had it done.",
          "I'll be very proud to.",
          "So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.",
          "We've got to open up the possibilities of this research.",
          "Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them.",
          "I might go back to one other thing.",
          "And then we would have to start all over again.",
          "Sure, there's more work to do.",
          "So that's one reason I don't want it.",
          "How are we going to do it?",
          "I don't think we need to do it.",
          "We can do better than this.",
          "I think that we could not afford not to do these things.",
          "It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue.",
          "That has been their priority.",
          "And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard.",
          "And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things.",
          "We ought to do that, then we can have a commission.",
          "If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be glad to go up there and we'll get it done.",
          "Now, it's our turn to take that torch.",
          "We've got to proceed very carefully on that.",
          "I wish you would have done this.",
          "It's time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism.",
          "I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.",
          "But everybody knew what we were doing and I've opposed that.",
          "It's almost become a way of life.",
          "Now we have a chance.",
          "And I think it's going down.",
          "We do that all the time.",
          "In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.",
          "It was a smart thing to do.",
          "I hope we can do it.",
          "So we've got to get it under control and there's one last point I'd make.",
          "This is wrong, and we have to do something about it.",
          "I'd like to see those written instructions.",
          "We are in a very difficult time.",
          "And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.",
          "And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.",
          "We wish you a lot of luck.",
          "You should expect that from both of us.",
          "And it's going to be tough.",
          "I know how to win.",
          "I believe we can and we ought to.",
          "And everybody's getting a fair shot.",
          "That's the most noble thing that anybody can do.",
          "But we know we've got lots of work to do.",
          "We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.",
          "That's not what we are going to do.",
          "Let me restate uh - our policy.",
          "That's what I feel passionately about.",
          "That's what I hope to get to talk about tonight.",
          "That's really about all we can do.",
          "That's going to be critical.",
          "That's what I want to focus on.",
          "There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.",
          "I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.",
          "The question is what we're going to do in the future.",
          "And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.",
          "And we will do that.",
          "Well, I've listened to both sides, and if they would talk to one another instead of throwing rocks, I think we could get a lot done.",
          "That was the right thing to do.",
          "Now, as long as we put up with that, that's what you're going to get.",
          "We've cut it in half.",
          "Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this.",
          "The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.",
          "We don't do anything to cut down on peak load requirements.",
          "Now, here's what I want to do.",
          "But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share.",
          "Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back.",
          "And we have a very good fight.",
          "I want to do something about that.",
          "Now, I'm going to reverse that.",
          "That's one way one could do it.",
          "And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment.",
          "Now we've got three of them.",
          "The rest of them know we're after them.",
          "What did we get for it?",
          "We need more resources there.",
          "And that's the way it should be.",
          "And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.",
          "But we've got to do even better.",
          "And I don't deserve that.",
          "Maybe we can work it out.",
          "We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.",
          "And I think that's the way it ought to be.",
          "In other words, we've got to be tough.",
          "Now I want to go further.",
          "And I believe that we used our skill.",
          "I think we have been right in carrying it.",
          "three ways to do that.",
          "... to -- to -- to...",
          "And we've got to maintain that pressure.",
          "If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time.",
          "So I am one who believes that we can",
          "That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.",
          "We'll continue to reach out.",
          "But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do.",
          "I'm just not going to do that.",
          "We've got to put our house in order.",
          "We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.",
          "There are we certainly ought to be able to",
          "Yes, we're getting the job done.",
          "We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it.",
          "But I know we can bring it back.",
          "You've got people doing two and three rotations.",
          "We have it on tape.",
          "That is the best way.",
          "I'm going to change that.",
          "This would not be done just on the first day.",
          "And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.",
          "I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.",
          "The question is our future.",
          "I don't think we can do that for a few years.",
          "But suppose we came up with that?",
          "I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal.",
          "But that's only step one.",
          "It has not worked the way that it has been promised.",
          "We have to help people succeed at home and at work.",
          "We're doing the best we possibly can to share information.",
          "And we have to be very strong.",
          "We've got to change it.",
          "I know you do it.",
          "We ought to insist on access.",
          "But this can't keep on going.",
          "There is more work to be done.",
          "I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.",
          "It is only in that way that we can persevere.",
          "And if we lose our will, we lose.",
          "Take it out of politics.",
          "It's going to be tough fighting.",
          "No longer do we give the image of being on the rise.",
          "All the things we can do.",
          "And we've got to attend to them.",
          "We know that the path we're taking is not working.",
          "And we're on the track on this one.",
          "Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.",
          "But there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments.",
          "We have to get a handle on it.",
          "I think we can do a better job.",
          "That's what I intend to do.",
          "But it's an honor that we have it.",
          "And I've stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and it's moving, not as fast as we'd like.",
          "Now, we all know that we've got to do more.",
          "They're willing to work with us.",
          "So at least we have time to work with it.",
          "We're going to tell you how to do it all.",
          "And, finally, we have to stand by our principles.",
          "I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.",
          "I see my time is running out here.",
          "We're going to build alliances.",
          "And this isn't -- this isn't going to be necessary.",
          "Yes, we want change but we are the change.",
          "What we need to do is go after...",
          "I certainly hope it won't.",
          "I think we have to revita1ize our society.",
          "Perhaps we might find that out tonight.",
          "So what should we do?",
          "Then you said we should.",
          "And I believe that we can bind our wounds.",
          "I knew it wouldn't work.\"",
          "We're moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing.",
          "And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term.",
          "And I'm going to make it a priority.",
          "It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done.",
          "That's the way we leave it.",
          "We could speed it up.",
          "I just don't believe we ought to do that.",
          "But I just have to...",
          "And I think we're going to win the House, okay?",
          "That's how they do things.",
          "We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.",
          "We don't have to settle for what we're going through.",
          "We need to demand on results.",
          "But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.",
          "It doesn't work that way.",
          "We have to help, it's very important.",
          "We can store and we can reprocess.",
          "He's mentioned some ways to do it--and I agree with those.",
          "Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we're doing going forward.",
          "You've had your chance and it didn't work.",
          "I think we ought to get at it.",
          "We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.",
          "Everybody ought to be in this thing.",
          "Now, what can we do?",
          "And I think we can do that.",
          "Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.",
          "No, I would make some changes.",
          "I am sure that that will not happen.",
          "Now that's not a flip-flop.",
          "We cannot move to the extreme.",
          "It's time for the man to leave.",
          "It's not going to happen on its own.",
          "We must make this next century the century of the individual.",
          "I believe that we can work together.",
          "We're going to get it done.",
          "We have to be able to make a difference.",
          "I believe we can be better.",
          "A message just won't do it.",
          "If we can get it done in the first year, you bet.",
          "We've also got to look to the future.",
          "That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.",
          "Now, what do we do about it?",
          "Maybe we will talk about some more before it's over.",
          "It's God's will, it'll happen.",
          "We're going to be able to.",
          "And how do we do that?",
          "This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.",
          "I'm going to hold that summit.",
          "Now, we may not succeed.",
          "It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.",
          "And we put up with that.",
          "They surely don't let me do that.",
          "We can do better, and we must.",
          "That we must cut back.",
          "And I don't think it should do that.",
          "That's got to be changed.",
          "And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.",
          "We can't settle for anything but the best.",
          "We get nothing for it.",
          "That's what it's meant to do.",
          "We'll take the proper action at the proper time.",
          "We don't need to do that any more.",
          "And we've got to do several things at the same time.",
          "We said, \"All right, if that's what you want to do.''",
          "So we're still in the fight.",
          "We need to do this together and we can.",
          "So we've got to do something for them.",
          "And our best days are ahead of us.",
          "But the last point I want to make is this.",
          "What we need is action.",
          "We're beginning to do it.",
          "So we're already beginning to see progress.",
          "And I hope it's as soon as possible.",
          "It's about where we are now.",
          "We got to cut it out.",
          "So, I don't want to fool around with it.",
          "This is not going to end well.",
          "And this is what we did.",
          "And if we do that, we can have an impact.",
          "Let's see how they do.",
          "I think we have to come together and work to change it.",
          "All of these things can be done.",
          "We've got to collect the taxes to do it.",
          "Now, they're the 2 folks involved so maybe if you put them together, they did it.",
          "And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology.",
          "Why do we have to do it?",
          "That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.",
          "I'm going to make sure --",
          "There are no magic answers to do it.",
          "But there's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done.",
          "And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.",
          "We're doing a little better in interdiction.",
          "This is not enough; it should be more.",
          "Maybe you can do it right now.",
          "I think this is the wrong direction.",
          "Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.",
          "We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead.",
          "It's important that we do that.",
          "We had to get their permission.",
          "Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done.",
          "I know we can do better.",
          "Are we doing enough in that area?",
          "We're making really good progress.",
          "I want the future, and I think we have to grab it.",
          "But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future.",
          "But we got to be more aggressive.",
          "And I don't want to do that.",
          "And that's exactly what it's done.",
          "Now that's what we have to do.",
          "We've got to do it now.",
          "And we can't allow it to happen anymore.",
          "That's not what we do.",
          "That's got to be changed.",
          "Now, I think that's going back to where we started.",
          "We've become very, very sloppy.",
          "We might have to do it slowly.",
          "We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s.",
          "And one last point I want to make.",
          "Success is going to bring us together.",
          "We were going to take care of everything for them.",
          "But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength.",
          "And so we said: Let's raise the standards.",
          "But it can sure be made better.",
          "I just can't do it.",
          "But I think this is indicative of what I would do.",
          "Well, we've taken the first step.",
          "What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.",
          "I want us to recapture that image.",
          "And let the world know - that's very important.",
          "Well, I think we're getting better all the time.",
          "We are back on the right track.",
          "Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.",
          "This has not been done, unfortunately.",
          "We do not have to do it.",
          "So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do?",
          "We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.",
          "I know what our needs are.",
          "Well, we've seen what has happened.",
          "This has got to be stopped.",
          "Step one, if I get up there, we're going to clean that up.",
          "We have to change that.",
          "And I hope that will happen.",
          "and that's where you begin.",
          "And there are ways of doing it.",
          "There must be an absolute guarantee.",
          "That's the wrong way to go.",
          "Now, you're paying for that.",
          "I believe we're overextended in too many places.",
          "Of course, we have to come together.",
          "I believe we can do better.",
          "People are stopped, and we have to do something about that.",
          "Now, it may very well be here in December you'll hear me say, I think there's a safe way to do it.",
          "Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.",
          "It is going to require a new spirit.",
          "That is how we move our nation forward.",
          "And we can't do that.",
          "We think that's pretty good progress.",
          "But it's not going to be easy.",
          "I don't like that idea.",
          "That's something I know how to do.",
          "What we need is people to stop talking and start doing.",
          "We don't have to do that.",
          "We've got this country going in the right direction.",
          "We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution.",
          "I know how to make that happen.",
          "I've learned not to do that.",
          "And I will keep that promise.",
          "And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.",
          "We've got to stop drifting.",
          "And I'm not going to do it.",
          "It's the most successful thing we've ever done.",
          "We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.",
          "And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.",
          "I think we're going to have to do it.",
          "And I think it will happen in my lifetime.",
          "And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.",
          "But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.",
          "That is not going to work.",
          "I believe we can be successful.",
          "And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.",
          "I think it ought to be a top priority.",
          "Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.",
          "It's time to end it.",
          "What do we have to do?",
          "I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it.",
          "We don't have an alternative.",
          "I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...",
          "But it isn't going to be working that way.",
          "I don't think we ought to join that.",
          "I know how to make that happen.",
          "That is the way it will stay.",
          "They say we should be satisfied.",
          "I don't know that it's going to work.",
          "We know where you're cutting right now.",
          "And we're going to keep on doing that.",
          "Tell Tony Blair we're going alone.",
          "And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.",
          "We have to change this whole culture.",
          "Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.",
          "And we need to do our part.",
          "This goes to our survival.",
          "But you have to work together.",
          "We've made real progress there.",
          "If we got along well, that would be good.",
          "Well, we can do better than that.",
          "I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.",
          "I don't believe that's the way to do it.",
          "Can we take the time --",
          "Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?",
          "and must do what he's talking about now.",
          "We do not help it.",
          "We need to do more.",
          "We can make it move.",
          "We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.",
          "Now, it may not work.",
          "There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done.",
          "It's just going to be talk.",
          "Now we have a chance.",
          "And we've got a good strategy.",
          "Now, that ought to get everybody back up to let's get along together and make it work.",
          "We've got to do something about this.",
          "Now, I don't think that's a bad idea.",
          "We need more work on value-added processing.",
          "And that's why we're doing what we're doing.",
          "That's one of the things I want to change.",
          "I want to build on that.",
          "And that's what I did, sir.",
          "So we've got to deal with that right away.",
          "Now, the question is, can we win?",
          "You have to make tough calls.",
          "We either have -- and by the way...",
          "We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.",
          "And if we can't love one another, we ought to get along with one another.",
          "I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.",
          "The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners.",
          "And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.",
          "I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk.",
          "It would not be appropriate for me to do so.",
          "This is what we have to do.",
          "We're having trouble meeting recruiting goals.",
          "We have got to do much more.",
          "So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.",
          "You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that?",
          "So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.",
          "This we must get across to the world.",
          "Let me tell you what we have done.",
          "We're talk about those two paths.",
          "So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.",
          "Now, I'm going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go.",
          "We need to do more and better.",
          "I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.",
          "One other point I would make: what could you do?",
          "And we've been in - on the whole, uninterested.",
          "It's time for a new path.",
          "And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.",
          "Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do.",
          "And then I brought folks together to get it done.",
          "Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.",
          "And we need to make it stronger.",
          "And the last point I just want to make.",
          "Another point I wanna make is this.",
          "We have to do this job.",
          "We have got to unite and pull together, and there's nothing we can't do.",
          "We'd better wait and see what the results are.",
          "And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.",
          "Say, \"Look, here's what we can do.",
          "We have to be bold.",
          "And that's what we've done.",
          "That's why we have to move forward and not go back.",
          "It's a time for unity.",
          "I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.",
          "This needs to be changed.",
          "That's not how you bring people together.",
          "I'm going to do this.'",
          "I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.",
          "I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.",
          "Now here's what we need to do.",
          "So what do we do?",
          "First of all, let me say what we have done.",
          "And frankly, now we're going to do it right.",
          "Now, I don't want to get into that --",
          "We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us.",
          "We cannot do it any longer, Lester.",
          "\"Oops, we haven't done the job.",
          "And so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top.",
          "We've done things that you never even thought of doing.",
          "I'd like to change that.",
          "We've got to make sure that works properly.",
          "Would we be better off as I believe, working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, you're on your own?",
          "I believe in this goal and effort with all my heart.",
          "And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.",
          "That's what we've been trying to do.",
          "That's the way I would do it.",
          "And I think right now we got to go back.",
          "And so we're matching them up.",
          "Now, we can do better.",
          "And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it.",
          "Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.",
          "In other words, there are practical things we can do.",
          "There's nothing we cannot do, if we do it together.",
          "We ought to say this is good.",
          "But let me talk back about where we've been.",
          "And I got a long history of doing that.",
          "And we can do it.",
          "We're doing this all around the world.",
          "It's time to have a fresh start.",
          "We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that's number one.",
          "I don't want to stampede.",
          "We've got to cut the red tape.",
          "Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?",
          "I'm going to be able to do it.",
          "I know because we did it there.",
          "I think we're making progress here.",
          "So I'll get rid of that.",
          "I know how to do that.",
          "No, I'm not sure I can promise that; I don't think either one of us can really.",
          "I don't think that'll work.",
          "And we're making progress there.",
          "I understand the importance of time but see, here's how we get to this mess we're in.",
          "I think that's the very best way to go.",
          "I hope a lot of --",
          "We had to make cuts.",
          "Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.",
          "I'm not going to do that; I won't do that.",
          "They'll never be the same.",
          "But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.",
          "I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.",
          "That's the task of the 21st century.",
          "If you make it as a young man, time passes.",
          "That's what we will do.",
          "This has been a very successful effort.",
          "I think we've got a lot more work to do.",
          "And we admire your pluck and perseverance.",
          "And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you.",
          "I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably.",
          "And we should be able to do that for our country.",
          "We have plenty of time.",
          "We're going to pull the country together.",
          "- it was impossible to work, it doesn't work -",
          "I suspect we won't agree here tonight.",
          "But we can do them all at once.",
          "And I'm sure you'll try to do it again.",
          "And I'm glad we're going in the right direction.",
          "I think they will, and I think we'll get there.",
          "We've turned it into a weakness.",
          "That sense is something that I want to restore.",
          "If we pull back in some isolation and say we don't have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we'll get involved in the future.",
          "I think that we do.",
          "how well it could be done.",
          "There was a chance to get this done.",
          "I'm very glad to do so.",
          "Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do.",
          "Let's not let them fool with it anymore.",
          "We simply cannot pull back.",
          "And I'm not going to allow that to happen.",
          "I'm convinced we'll do it.",
          "That's not going to work.",
          "Now none of that will happen anymore.",
          "We have made remarkable success.",
          "And that's to be honored.",
          "And we are doing a better job of it.",
          "We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.",
          "But I've always tried in whatever I've done is to bring people together.",
          "We have to make it possible.",
          "I don't force you to do anything.",
          "The \"we\" is you and me.",
          "I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.",
          "I can't handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later.",
          "We're going to have to-the MX.",
          "It is working, and we're going to continue on that same line.",
          "And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.",
          "We're backing up at every way we possibly can.",
          "We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.",
          "We cannot have it in our hearts.",
          "We need to keep that in line.",
          "We will do what we do best.",
          "We should come to its defense.",
          "Look at the mess that we're in.",
          "But I finally did it.",
          "And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.",
          "And we have this arms race underway.",
          "I think we're ready to move.",
          "It's time for the man to go.",
          "We have to be firm and strong.",
          "And if we find success we'll praise it.",
          "But we did something else that was interesting.",
          "We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.",
          "That is what I want to do.",
          "That doesn't get the job done.",
          "And I'm going to try to do better.",
          "Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.",
          "Now we have to succeed.",
          "We need to move in a new direction.",
          "But we got to have a knowledge base.",
          "So we have to do two things, as I said.",
          "Here's what we'' -- give them a demonstration and then say -- \"Here's what we can do.",
          "You've got to help us over there.",
          "It may be a long period, but we must - we must get started immediately.",
          "We certainly must maintain an engagement there.",
          "We don't know what's going to happen.",
          "We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...",
          "I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.",
          "We've got a plan to do so.",
          "We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.",
          "But I'm not going to do that.",
          "Then I would really focus on let's get these things out.",
          "I could do that very quickly.",
          "We will commit more over time to help.",
          "Now, I want to build on that.",
          "And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves.",
          "Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still.",
          "And here's what we can do.",
          "I'm going to bring them together.",
          "We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over.",
          "But that's happening as we sit here today.",
          "But we get the job done.",
          "We can be once again.",
          "And I promise you that that will happen.",
          "So here's what we do.",
          "I hope not in both cases.",
          "Do you want to go first?",
          "Now we tried to do this under President Bush.",
          "But I -- I couldn't do that.",
          "A lot remains to be done.",
          "We need a lot of things.",
          "No, we'll get it done.",
          "No, I don't happen to share that goal.",
          "I'm ready to go at it right now.",
          "I'll give you everything I have, if you want me to do it.",
          "I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.",
          "We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.",
          "We have to be sure to maintain that.",
          "It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years.",
          "And it's going to be tough.",
          "We've got to turn this thing around.",
          "I don't want to jump in.",
          "And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.",
          "We should do it in phases.",
          "It's something to build on.",
          "Well, maybe someday, somebody can dream of that.",
          "It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.",
          "We can do better than that.",
          "We need to have transparency.",
          "Give me a chance to do that.",
          "I've said it's going to take some work.",
          "We had a better idea.",
          "We can do better than that.",
          "You'll virtually -- it's virtually impossible given our regulations.\"",
          "I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.",
          "We need to do more than that.",
          "We never should go back to that.",
          "And that's going to be my job.",
          "Let me just say that obviously tonight we're going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do.",
          "It's time for a new look.",
          "Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it or saying you can get across yourself?",
          "We don't want to go back to that.",
          "And we're in real trouble on that.",
          "We've got to go back and look.",
          "So I'm not planning on making changes there.",
          "We've got to help them.",
          "To the extent humanly possible, we get that out.",
          "So I want to do something about that.",
          "There are some things that I think have to be done.",
          "We have got to pull together.",
          "We've got to make things here.",
          "Well, we have come to that position.",
          "Now, there's more work to do.",
          "So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though.",
          "That's why we're moving in the right direction.",
          "We've got them all out there.",
          "This is an essential that we get it right.",
          "Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all.",
          "And we can do it, too.",
          "We're going as fast as the experts say we should.",
          "So what we have to do is two things.",
          "And they're going to do that.",
          "And I think this will work.",
          "What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.",
          "Instead of going in and talking to people and saying, \\Let's get everybody together.\"",
          "Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments as to how we ought to do it.",
          "I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard.",
          "That's the way I will run it.",
          "And those pessimists who say it can't be done, I'm sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them",
          "So, under the circumstances, what do we do?",
          "And that's exactly what we're going to do.",
          "I mean, that's been done.",
          "We're going to go through a period of shared sacrifice.",
          "But I believe together we can make great progress.",
          "But there's a better way to do it.",
          "I think there are things to do in this regard.",
          "And we made good progress early on.",
          "And we're making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction.",
          "You've done a great job.",
          "I know how the do that, my friends.",
          "We're far away from that now.",
          "We should have -- wait one second.",
          "Together we can get anything done.",
          "I'm tired of being told we can't.",
          "How do you do it?",
          "I know I'm ready for it.",
          "And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.",
          "And that's exactly what I did.",
          "I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.",
          "We later said no, that's not true.",
          "We're going to do it like you do it.",
          "Well another thing we can do.",
          "We do and I hope...",
          "Let me say -- I certainly hope so.",
          "I'm going to change that.",
          "In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it.",
          "It's going to go in the other direction, as they've estimated.",
          "And we need to reverse that.",
          "And I'm happy to tell you that we have.",
          "Now I believe there's a better way to do this.",
          "Let's get on with it.",
          "So here's what I would do.",
          "We have to do a lot of things.",
          "I hope we can succeed.",
          "I'm so glad that I have the chance to knock that down.",
          "I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.",
          "No, I don't believe it's going to happen.",
          "And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster.",
          "And we've got a lot of work to do.",
          "All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes.",
          "But this is an exciting time.",
          "But we have some work to do.",
          "We did, 25 percent across the board.",
          "Now, if you don't want to really do that I'm not your man.",
          "They said, let us win.",
          "But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.",
          "We've done a great job.",
          "We want them to continue that.",
          "But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and that's what I'm talking about.",
          "Well, we're on the right track.",
          "But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.",
          "But -- but it'll -- it'll -- it'll be...",
          "And we need to do something about that.",
          "And it has not been easy.",
          "We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.",
          "We're not giving this away for nothing.",
          "So that'll stay the same.",
          "We'll even give it to you.",
          "Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.",
          "They said, let us win.",
          "And I think that's an important transition.",
          "Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we're not getting the best cooperation in the world today.",
          "That's why it's essential we win.",
          "And that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.",
          "But we're not there yet.",
          "I've been trying so hard not to.",
          "And I said, what can we do about it.",
          "But we shouldn't have been there in the first place.",
          "Put a head fake on us.",
          "Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful.",
          "Sure, I'm willing to do that.",
          "Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about.",
          "I will try to do the same thing.",
          "Well, we'll include it in that.",
          "There is much to be done.",
          "It's going to help everything.",
          "That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.",
          "Could we do another round on it?",
          "Well again, if you're somebody thinking about the future, I think it's fair to say that it'll be -- we'll work it out.",
          "And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.",
          "I'd be delighted to, because you can't do it the old way.",
          "But John is right we have to make cuts.",
          "That the best is over.",
          "I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.",
          "And we need to win that future.",
          "They're going to do a tremendous job.",
          "That's not appropriate to do.",
          "He went over to say we must make the very changes they're making now.",
          "It seems like they can't get it done.",
          "That wasn't going to work.",
          "We ought to be shutting those down.",
          "It's time to get something done.",
          "But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.",
          "That's what we caught him doing.",
          "So how do we deal with it?",
          "Good, I look forward to it.",
          "And so we've got to reverse this.",
          "That's why I think we shouldn't do it that quickly.",
          "We've been challenged, and we've risen to those challenges.",
          "So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.",
          "And I believe I can.",
          "We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.",
          "And that's what we're doing.",
          "That's not going to happen.",
          "This is how I'm going to get it done.",
          "It hasn't worked out that way.",
          "We ought to make one last effort.",
          "I believe we could have done better.",
          "We sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it.",
          "Of course, we're paying attention to these.",
          "But now we have a chance.",
          "How did we do that?",
          "We don't have to live like this.",
          "So I think the answer is to build on it.",
          "And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that.",
          "That's what I thought we ought to do.",
          "I believe we can do it.",
          "They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again.",
          "If not, it's going to continue.'",
          "I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.",
          "I think you can work on all three at once, Tom.",
          "We cannot let it happen.",
          "We have to tell the truth.",
          "What do we do then?",
          "The answer was we got...",
          "I think that's wrong, and I think we can do better.",
          "And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working.",
          "Is that the way it works?",
          "I've worked on that long and hard.",
          "But more importantly it is true that in order for us to be competitive, we're going to have to make some smart choices right now.",
          "And that's what I do.",
          "So what did we do?",
          "We had a better idea.",
          "But it's good that we have them.",
          "They have to help us out.",
          "I'm not going to do that.",
          "We have got to have the courage to change.",
          "If we can come together, nothing can stop us.",
          "We need all the talent we can get.",
          "And there will be a significant transition.",
          "We couldn't get it done, because I wasn't enforceable.",
          "And that's what we're going to do.",
          "That's not what I'm going to do.",
          "But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position.",
          "I've shown I know how to do so.",
          "And I think I'm on the right track.",
          "And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.",
          "We need a new approach.",
          "And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that.",
          "There's no -- and we have to do them all at once.",
          "They're not able to do it and our future depends upon it.",
          "And that's what I've done administratively.",
          "This is what I have done.",
          "One last point I want to make.",
          "So that's not where we ought to go.",
          "And I'm looking forward to having that debate.",
          "So here's what I would do.",
          "We are all in this together.",
          "I hope we can talk more about that.",
          "We worked too hard to lower it.",
          "It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.",
          "I think that should be a goal.",
          "And there's a whole bunch of other things that I can't click off in this short period of time.",
          "And I think that's that's the thrust we will make.",
          "But are we doing enough in these areas?",
          "Now, we have come back from that abyss.",
          "But the important thing is what are we going to do now?",
          "And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.",
          "But I thought it would cost a lot -- I think there's a better way to do it.",
          "Yes, we should make a great effort.",
          "And I don't want to do that, and I won't do that.",
          "But it isn't going to get the job done if we don't change K through 12."

          "I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.",
          "Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.",

          "Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we've been investing in; but also, we've got to make sure we're building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now.",

          "But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem.",
          "We had an even worse oil shock in 1979.",

          "We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh - energy uh - forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor.",
          "But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.",

          "I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future.",
          "Obviously energy is going to be a big, big factor.",
          "I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused.",

          "We actually do give it to solar and wind--",
          "But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.",
          "Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.",
          "So, if you buy a battery in this country, you buy a solar panel, it's being produced in a plant in China powered by coal where it's being powered by oil and gas at 20 percent off.",
          "It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.",
          "And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.",
          "Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers.",

          "We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.",
          "And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.",
          "We're gonna run out of oil.",

          "We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.",
          "Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent.",

          "We are energy rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.",
          "As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent.",
          "We don't know what the future's going to bring.",
          "And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling.",
          "Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.",
          "Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead.",
          "And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?",
          "So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions.",
          "In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future.",

          "I would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil.",
          "We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.",
          "Because it was driving energy prices through the sky.",
          "Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up.",
          "Even though it's true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day.",
          "But we are putting our energy companies out of business.",
          "Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them.",
          "That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.",
          "If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.",
          "We have no energy policy.",
          "the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible.",
          "And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.",
          "You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.",
          "In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.",
          "That's why I have a plan for energy independence within 10 years.",
          "We can build a new modern electric grid.",
          "I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.",
          "It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there.",
          "In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.",
          "So the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that's hurting rather badly.",
          "... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas.",
          "This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy.",
          "So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.",
          "I support clean coal technology.",

          "We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in -- in car companies like Tesla and -- and Fisker, making electric battery cars.",
          "The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.",
          "The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.",
          "And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.",

          "In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.",
          "But I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet.",
          "We're going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million more jobs in this country.",
          "There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.",
          "I was in coal country.",
          "We can offshore drill now.",
          "We are energy independent for the first time.",
          "I headed up the Recovery Act, which put more money into moving away from fossil fuels to -- to solar and wind energy than ever has occurred in the history of America.",
          "You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.",
          "One last point I want to make on energy.",
          "I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf.",
          "It called for uh - conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have.",
          "We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.",
          "We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs.",
          "We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.",
          "New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.",
          "I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.",
          "You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.",
          "Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.",
          "Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.",
          "We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology.",
          "And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've -- we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once.",
          "And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo.",
          "That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.",
          "And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming."

          "But let's get at the bottom line.",

          "And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part.",
          "Let me go back to the main point, Sandy.",
          "And I think there may be a couple of reasons.",
          "You've got to show you're serious in that regard.",
          "You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking.",
          "Let's get that straight right away.",
          "My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.",
          "I'll give you a couple of examples.",
          "I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.",
          "So let me get this right.",
          "Now this just wasn't true.",
          "So that's -- that's number one.",
          "And I think I did a good job.",
          "Well can I have the last word on this?",
          "I think I've addressed it.",
          "Now, that's not my analysis.",
          "But -- and I say that about a lot of things.",

          "I don't agree with that.",
          "I did not say that.",
          "No, I might as well just go with -- --",

          "We have answered this so many times, is the thing.",

          "It's naive and dangerous to say that.",
          "I commend it to anybody.",
          "That's -- that's important, of course.",
          "No more than the question you just asked him.",
          "And I was embarrassed by it.",
          "Is that a new question or a 30-second question?",
          "Right, thank you for that.",

          "But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might.",
          "I did not say that.",
          "Well, as a matter of fact there is.",
          "I just don't believe that's the answer.",
          "But -- OK. All right.",
          "Now, those are the details as we have them.",
          "Here -- I know, but here's the thing.",
          "We need to be talking about space.",
          "I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing.",
          "Now give me 1 second...",
          "I've got no illusions about that.",
          "No one is suggesting that.",
          "I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it.",
          "So this is, that's a good start.",
          "Look, it's just not true.",
          "I happen to support that.",
          "And I'm pretty good at it.",
          "There's nothing wrong with that.",
          "Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it's much clearer for me now.",
          "That is my agenda and that is why I think that it's not just a question of experience.",
          "But, I'll let you all parse that out.",
          "I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness.",
          "I would disagree with it.",
          "I think that speaks for itself.",
          "I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...",
          "Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different.",
          "That made no sense whatsoever.",
          "I think first of all, let me -- let me repeat -- let me repeat what I said.",
          "I'd like to respond to that.",
          "Nobody is even talking about that.",
          "I've talked with a number of them.",
          "And I would just say that it seems to me that that's the way it ought to be.",
          "Let me just make this comment.",
          "Well I'm glad you asked.",
          "I don't think you can deny that.",
          "So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this.",
          "Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.",
          "would agree with us as well.",
          "That is the true way I feel.",
          "Let me do first on a personal level.",
          "But the reason for that is obvious.",
          "The when I can't tell you.",
          "You can look at me.",
          "And I've made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority.",
          "And I would say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement.",
          "Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.",
          "Well, I did with my first statement.",
          "I'll close on this point.",
          "And in a way, I should be complaining.",
          "I don't know, maybe you're not.",
          "There is another point that should be made.",
          "That was what he said.",
          "Yes, that's true, I didn't.",
          "I hope I'm that person.",
          "I ask each of you just to look into your hearts, look into your guts.",
          "Oh you gotta be kidding.",
          "But let's look at the facts here.",
          "If I could respond to that.",
          "That answer almost made me want to scowl.",
          "That's what I'm all about.",
          "I mean, we agree with that.",
          "Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again.",
          "So let's not be throwing stones about it.",
          "Let's get to their questions.",
          "Anyway, that's for another debate.",
          "I mention the last debate --",
          "I don't, I don't know what to say.",
          "So I'd rather talk about my strengths.",
          "It's kind of one of those exaggerations.",
          "I was going to say something...",
          "More so you than me.",
          "Well, I guess some may be better off.",
          "And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?",
          "I'm not just saying this.",
          "And so I don't know what the answer is.",
          "Well, I actually agree with that.",
          "Let me give you an example.",
          "I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.",
          "I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.",
          "I can't say it any more plainly.",
          "You want me to answer a question --",
          "You've shared your stories with me.",
          "Let me make one last point.",
          "As a matter of fact,.",
          "I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.",
          "Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.",
          "And I just had to work that in.",
          "Well, they've got a point.",
          "I gotta get it in perspective.",
          "I have clear eyes on this.",
          "Not if I didn't have a better idea.",
          "If you think that was good, then you do.",
          "You mean, I have to answer his stuff?",
          "I just have to say something.",
          "That is absolutely not true.",
          "And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.",
          "And my word is good.",
          "And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh - identify any particular course of action uh - when I responded to a question a week or so ago.",
          "There's no question about that.",
          "And we need to be very clear about that.",
          "You got that fact wrong.",
          "Well, thank you for asking your question.",
          "But let me mention another thing.",
          "That was something I concurred with...",
          "Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add.",
          "Those are the questions we need answered.",
          "I could have rationalized it.",
          "And so I just have to say, it's fine.",
          "I don't just talk about it.",
          "You have -- wait a minute.",
          "I ask you for your help.",
          "Can I respond to that?",
          "Now, here's what I believe.",
          "Let me come back and -- and answer your question.",
          "And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.",
          "Now let's just see what this means.",
          "I know how these people think.",
          "I know a lot about that.",
          "So let's talk about this.",
          "Oh, I'm it's my question.",
          "Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.",
          "I'm the last one, right?",
          "The question is, was this wise?",
          "I'm glad you clarified it.",
          "You talk about somebody strong.",
          "Can I comment on that?",
          "And that's about all I can say in a minute.",
          "That's an interruption, by the way.",
          "I will tell you this.",
          "I do want to make sure that...",
          "So, I don't know if I get a chance to respond.",
          "I didn't get to make a comment on this.",
          "And so I think you take a look at it.",
          "Because you have nothing to say.",
          "I'll tell you this, I want to do something about this.",
          "I understand how hard it is.",
          "But let's look at it.",
          "The answer is very straightforward.",
          "He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.",
          "But I can take it.",
          "I'll give you an example.",
          "Let me give you an example.",
          "I don't know, I'm not questioning anybody.",
          "That says something about character.",
          "Just -- would you like to hear...",
          "But is that really the question that should be asked?",
          "Let's don't -- you don't have to believe it.",
          "And you know what you'll find?",
          "But that was something that happened.",
          "So I will tell you this.",
          "You can't talk about it rationally.",
          "But it's in your hands.",
          "And that's my view now.",
          "But I feel very strongly about that.",
          "And that's what concerns me.",
          "But these are important questions.",
          "So let me try to answer you in this way.",
          "And you see, yes, my position has evolved.",
          "It's pretty clear you won't admit...",
          "It's a good one, though.",
          "And I'm very proud of it.",
          "Let me just finish the point.",
          "There's no question about that.",
          "I think everybody knows that.",
          "And I think I know what he meant by that.",
          "No, I don't think that's the right answer.",
          "Well, I have to respond.",
          "Now, let me just go back with you very briefly.",
          "Boy, great question and important question, because you're absolutely right.",
          "You talk about mixed messages.",
          "Now I don't know all the answers.",
          "But that's what I feel.",
          "I'll make one more point.",
          "But let me respond to what you said.",
          "Let me tell you what the facts are.",
          "You know what that is?",
          "Look, don't deny that the question is there.",
          "I don't agree with that statement.",
          "Let's look at the position.",
          "But I hope that from here on you will no longer be saying that particular thing, which is absolutely false.",
          "And I cannot let that stand, because it isn't true.",
          "And by the way, I've had that experience.",
          "But I have common sense.",
          "So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.",
          "And what I'm going to say is this.",
          "And I don't want to respond in kind to all these things.",
          "That is absolutely not true.",
          "We talk about it all the time.",
          "Let me just -- I've got to answer this.",
          "I never got to say that.",
          "You know what it is?",
          "And I try not to.",
          "That I can tell you.",
          "Well, let me--I have to correct one thing.",
          "And one thing I have to say.",
          "And secondly, I repeat to you --",
          "Come on, give me five.",
          "There's no doubt about it.",
          "Did you ask me a question?",
          "Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.",
          "See, there's a lot I don't understand.",
          "He's got to get this thing more clear.",
          "Let's put it in perspective.",
          "I am not quoting myself.",
          "Well let me make one thing clear.",
          "And you know what happens?",
          "Just so you put it out.",
          "And by the way, I've done these things.",
          "But it didn't mean that.",
          "It was rather a vague statement that they finally made.",
          "Whether that helps or not, I don't know.",
          "He said, \"I don't know.",
          "I'll look at it at the time.",
          "Well, that just isn't true.",
          "Well, it is an open discussion.",
          "Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.",
          "But that's as far as I would go with it.",
          "Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.",
          "And that's why I support that.",
          "No, I don't have an answer for everything.",
          "I'm trying to decipher that.",
          "I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat.",
          "Again, I will say I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults.",
          "Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...",
          "And you know how you can trust me about that?",
          "Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.",
          "We don't talk about it.",
          "This is about, somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we're together.",
          "You may have said that, too.",
          "In terms of in response to the question, no.",
          "This is what I deeply believe.",
          "And you know what happened?",
          "But that's not the question.",
          "Right now we heard it.",
          "I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.",
          "You do a lot of things nobody knows about.",
          "And I'll tell you what.",
          "But that in and of itself was a good thing.",
          "That, to me, is the key.",
          "And some would say maybe me more so than others.",
          "And I know that I'm someone older than you.",
          "There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.",
          "That's how strongly I feel about it.",
          "Let me just give you one other example.",
          "Now he's having to say that again.",
          "You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.",
          "But it has taken place.",
          "Well, wait, but it's very important.",
          "I think it's important and I share it.",
          "Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.",
          "But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.",
          "But I would just say this.",
          "I think that answers itself.",
          "But you don't have to wonder if it's me talking.",
          "I'd like to respond to that.",
          "I know how these people think.",
          "And I said it numerous times.",
          "(Laughter and applause) But--but--see, let me make it very clear.",
          "It's important that people know.",
          "I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.",
          "And the answer is, \"Absolutely not.\"",
          "I do understand how to make things work.",
          "Some of it's said in entertainment.",
          "And I think I've had that.",
          "But it is things that people say.",
          "I'll give you an example.",
          "So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.",
          "And I'll tell you exactly how.",
          "If I had it to do over again I might answer the questions a little better.",
          "That is simply not the case...",
          "And the answer is I don't believe people think that's the case --",
          "And we talk about evidence.",
          "I don't take it personally.",
          "And I know it's necessary.",
          "You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.",
          "... and the rest of the answer, way off the mark.",
          "Can I make another point?",
          "I just do want to say one thing, however.",
          "Yes, I'd like to respond very much.",
          "Well, we've had this discussion before.",
          "Now, you cite a study.",
          "So I get the last question -- last answer --",
          "And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.",
          "It's as simple as that.",
          "If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else.",
          "And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.",
          "Let me go back a minute to racial divisiveness.",
          "So I consider that a compliment.",
          "You've got to say what you're for and you've got to --",
          "Let me comment on that.",
          "I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.",
          "And that's what I would say to that person.",
          "Tell you what I hear.",
          "And I'll tell you exactly why.",
          "Because the question you ask is important.",
          "You have to see it to believe it.",
          "It's really -- it's really very interesting.",
          "And I know how to work with them.",
          "And so please, go to...",
          "I wrote about that in my book...",
          "I think you can see that.",
          "Again, I'd say if they asked us to play some reasonable role, I don't know how I would respond.",
          "Let's talk about them separately.",
          "Let's start with a premise.",
          "Now, I know the criticism of this.",
          "Thirty-second quick answer to that.",
          "I told you never would I do such a thing.",
          "Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report.",
          "And I'm very proud of that.",
          "I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.",
          "Well, I'm glad you raised that question.",
          "I'll go one step further.",
          "I don't think you do think that.",
          "And I've told everything I know about it.",
          "I have heard you say this time after time.",
          "People can look it up, you're right.",
          "And I just told you the facts, sir.",
          "\"I think that makes sense.",
          "And you do have experience.",
          "And I wish we had time to let me explain.",
          "But you want to know the truth?",
          "I will say this -",
          "And I truly respect it.",
          "That shows a lack of understanding.",
          "That's how much I care about it.",
          "That's just one tiny example.",
          "And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those answers were affirmative.",
          "Yes, let me respond to this.",
          "I think it can be.",
          "So don't tell me about words.",
          "I certainly agree with that.",
          "Why, I had a great response to that.",
          "But let me start with what you said.",
          "I don't think it's fair to say, you know, whatever it is, that if you haven't been hit by it personally.",
          "I ask for your vote.",
          "I'm asking you to see me for who I really am.",
          "Just -- just -- just a quick follow-up, because I think -- I think this is important.",
          "As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.",
          "And that's a good thing.",
          "But I can tell you this.",
          "No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.",
          "Well, I hope I made my answer clear.",
          "And let me tell you...",
          "See, here is the mentality.",
          "I happen to believe it is.",
          "But that -- that is not the case.",
          "So I would say just, you know, look at all three of us.",
          "And the answer they came up with was this:",
          "And that's saying something in that bunch.",
          "You asked me a question.",
          "But that's the good news.",
          "Let me give you one example.",
          "And one last thing -- just -- just to make this point.",
          "And I've been very clear to them.",
          "But look, let me sum it up.",
          "Now, that's another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight.",
          "I think I remember the question.",
          "That's one that I understand and certainly will carry out.",
          "I'd like to just respond, if I might.",
          "Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this.",
          "Maybe that's part of the answer.",
          "There is no doubt about it.",
          "Look, it's just not true.",
          "So it's not one thing.",
          "And I never made that statement; never would.",
          "Could I just respond to this, please?",
          "Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...",
          "I ask you for your trust.",
          "Now, to -- I still -- I just have a minute here?",
          "You'll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy.",
          "And I think that's great.",
          "That's the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about.",
          "It's very clear to me.",
          "Well, let me just say I would...",
          "And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.",
          "Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not true what he said.",
          "That is the bottom line.",
          "You know, it's just not that simple.",
          "Let me just say to you, number one, don't throw the labels around.",
          "I heard more of the same.",
          "And I'm very proud of it.",
          "Let me just mention three things very quickly.",
          "The other thing, it's nice.",
          "And I have to make that judgment.",
          "And so let me just say this.",
          "This is a big question.",
          "Now let me just tell you a little story.",
          "I mean, look at the facts.",
          "And you should go down and take a look at that.",
          "I don't think that's true at all.",
          "I don't know how you draw that line.",
          "I would just like to s- add this one point.",
          "You know, here's what I would say.",
          "And I said that at that time.",
          "One final point if I might.",
          "And, you know, that's -- you're right.",
          "Again, you can look it up.",
          "This is just another lie.",
          "That happens to be a fact.",
          "And so it's a combination of these things.",
          "And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.",
          "No one else believes that's the case.",
          "That's not what I believe.",
          "In fact, I have written a book about it.",
          "You know what he said?",
          "And so my question is...",
          "That's part -- that's part one.",
          "Let me get out of your way here.",
          "I don't claim to know all the answers.",
          "Well -- well, I need to speak a moment...",
          "So, it does play a part in my life.",
          "But I think it's time to talk about the future.",
          "Under your direction, to a large extent.",
          "No, but I'm glad you asked that question, because I know it's on many peoples' minds.",
          "That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.",
          "And let me explain why.",
          "And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?",
          "That is what it is.",
          "And look at what's happening.",
          "And not about personal things.",
          "There's no question about that.",
          "Actually, I understand it pretty well.",
          "Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he...",
          "Now, that's not in my gut.",
          "I just want to make sure that --",
          "I'm sure you probably have heard that.",
          "First of all, that's simply not true what he just said, of course.",
          "No, I didn't say that at all.",
          "There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.",
          "I did not say that.",
          "No, let me tell you something about that.",
          "And, again, I know those situations.",
          "Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.",
          "I will look at it at the time.",
          "I say it all the time.",
          "Now that was quite an admission.",
          "And it wasn't very detailed.",
          "I'll keep you in suspense.",
          "I notice you bring that up a lot.",
          "I never said any such thing.",
          "I'm glad you clarified that.",
          "That would be my position.",
          "I commend you for supporting that.",
          "What I ask is this.",
          "If I could say one thing.",
          "I'm shocked to hear that.",
          "... just a quick follow-up on this.",
          "And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.",
          "Well, it is what it is because you are who you are.",
          "But here's the point he misses.",
          "So we have to look at this comprehensively.",
          "Well, there's a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it.",
          "So I would be firm.",
          "I can tell you, it's rife.",
          "Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said.",
          "So I really don't think so.",
          "I have no hesitancy in saying so.",
          "And that's the way I feel.",
          "Here's the -- here's the bottom line.",
          "And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.",
          "But I'll tell you this.",
          "Not a single thing, number one.",
          "If I can answer the question.",
          "And I don't agree with them.",
          "I see what it does.",
          "I can't emphasize to you how much.",
          "But, George, that's no answer.",
          "I'm happy to talk about this.",
          "But let me go a step further.",
          "Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.",
          "Well, here we go again.",
          "Well, I think the answer uh - as to the kind of person that I would select uh - is obvious.",
          "And I can prove it.",
          "I do not say that.",
          "But in -- oh, but I do.",
          "Well, I would say first of all, I think, it's a very good question.",
          "But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating.",
          "... but -- but -- but overall.",
          "I find that just absolutely...",
          "I'm going to keep my word to you.",
          "Well, it was very -- I say nothing.",
          "Therefore, you don't know what's it like.",
          "Well, I'll tell you what it means.",
          "That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case.",
          "I find that deeply disturbing.",
          "And you know what they said to us?",
          "And I'm frankly surprised you didn't pay more attention to that example.",
          "Now, you know, watch this -- listen very carefully to this.",
          "Let me give you an example.",
          "There's no doubt about it.",
          "... talking about it this evening.",
          "Let me just tell you.",
          "But let me just tell you.",
          "I said well, this is simple.",
          "That's the point I made.",
          "I'll give you an example.",
          "I want it to be clearer.",
          "You've got to read what he said.",
          "And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.",
          "I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.",
          "But I will tell you, I sat there...",
          "That's-at least that's what I read.",
          "Let -- let -- let's...",
          "I -- I have to respond to that.",
          "Well, can I answer that?",
          "I think you ought to have at least one answer to it.",
          "I don't have a response.",
          "Now, if that's true, just tell me now.",
          "Well, let me just make a closing point.",
          "Let me -- let me complete...",
          "So I say this is very simple.",
          "No, I don't think there is.",
          "Now, why does that matter?",
          "I would love to respond.",
          "Let me make one other point.",
          "But I also believe something else about that.",
          "But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.",
          "And I think that's a good thing.",
          "You should know as much as possible about each of us.",
          "Now, let me just share something.",
          "Again, a little bit of naivete there.",
          "Now it's true that we disagree on this.",
          "Yeah, you did say that.",
          "I'll give you an example.",
          "Well, let's admit it then.",
          "Let's just answer the question.",
          "But let me -- let me not just stop there.",
          "We heard the same thing.",
          "I did it for the very reasons you say.",
          "I think that's part of it.",
          "Let me just give you one tiny example.",
          "And it would be very difficult for me to answer that in any short period of time.",
          "I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person.",
          "Let me call your attention to the key word there.",
          "I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.",
          "All I say is this.",
          "And I just want to make one thing very clear.",
          "And everything in there says what I am for.",
          "Am I allowed to respond to that?",
          "This is my point tonight.",
          "Excuse me, he made a statement.",
          "Let me first give you a sports update.",
          "But that's not what I believe.",
          "And you know, I caught it.",
          "Well, I -- I do think...",
          "You must be tough and smart.",
          "I don't go along with it.",
          "So what is the answer?",
          "That would be my answer to this question.",
          "I tell it like it is.",
          "Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics.",
          "And let me say this.",
          "Now, I'll tell ya this.",
          "Let me say something about Columbine.",
          "But let me comment on the report.",
          "And we know what happened.",
          "And that's what I want to talk about.",
          "If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this.",
          "I want to say just a couple of things.",
          "I'm happy to answer the question.",
          "And let me give you an example of what I mean.",
          "I do know what he has said about mine.",
          "And that's just the way it is.",
          "That's not what I think.",
          "Let me tell you something.",
          "And the result is that you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other.",
          "Here is what I believe, sir.",
          "And I believe the answer to that has to also be \"yes.''",
          "Well, let me give you some advice.",
          "So that is my answer to this question.",
          "I think this is a great example.",
          "Now the second point we have to understand is this, however.",
          "I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.",
          "I hope you don't think that.",
          "Let me uh - speak out very strongly.",
          "And that's not the facts.",
          "There's no way of glossing around that.",
          "And I want to tell you what I tell them.",
          "Well, I just want to say...",
          "And I want to come back to something I said before.",
          "Well, I have no idea.",
          "I think I should respond to that.",
          "I've spelled out my position.",
          "If you knew anything about...",
          "Well, let me just follow up, my friends.",
          "But let's -- let's mention -- let me mention the other one.",
          "And I appreciate that question.",
          "And so I've told him my opinion.",
          "But here's what I do know.",
          "By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth.",
          "I do want to make sure that -- I do want to make sure that we just understand something.",
          "There's nothing the matter with that.",
          "You've got to read what he said...",
          "If the question -- maybe I -- get it wrong.",
          "But I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned.",
          "So I don't want the implication to be that somehow everything we say is just cooked up and put in our head by somebody else.",
          "So let's go through them one by one.",
          "But that's not the point here.",
          "So I'm very honored by all of that.",
          "Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.",
          "Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said.",
          "Well, I think I did a much better job.",
          "I think you have to look at it.",
          "Hey, I'll answer the question.",
          "So I'll just keep saying, I am one.",
          "Well, let me just correct something very quickly.",
          "Now let me come directly to your question.",
          "For one thing, let me just follow up here.",
          "I believe that's the answer.",
          "And I have done a lot...",
          "And that didn't make any sense."

          "Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate.",
          "This is what a president has to do.",
          "Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.",
          "And I doubt in all candor if the president knows it.",
          "And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.",
          "So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.",
          "If the president has any interest tonight, I'll detail it to you; I won't take 10 minutes tonight.",
          "And I do think that you can't turn the White House into the Waffle House.",
          "And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.",
          "He has no respect for our president.",
          "He would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.",
          "I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh - the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out.",
          "He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.",
          "And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president.",
          "Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may.",
          "I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened, when our treaty commitments are at stake, when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest, and that is a part of being president.",
          "I'll be against it when I'm president.",
          "And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States.",
          "But I will be a president whose personal commitment is to continue doing this work.",
          "He can't stay in power.",
          "And if you want a tough President who uses that strength to get arms control and draws the line in the heavens, vote for Walter Mondale.",
          "As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth.",
          "But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go.",
          "Now we have a majority and we get a president.",
          "Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.",
          "You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.",
          "I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.",
          "I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries.",
          "That happened on this president's watch.",
          "And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.",
          "But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States.",
          "If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.",
          "Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make.",
          "And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally.",
          "That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.",
          "If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.",
          "In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States.",
          "That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly.",
          "I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president's term and even further back than that, that we'd have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn't explode in the way that it did.",
          "I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us.",
          "I hope as president that I've earned your trust.",
          "I'm going to be a president who believes in science.",
          "And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.",
          "When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call.",
          "And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper.",
          "There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.",
          "And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.",
          "And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce.",
          "And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.",
          "If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.",
          "It's about selecting a president of the United States.",
          "You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.",
          "I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country.",
          "America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.",
          "We're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.",
          "I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.",
          "Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words.",
          "Tonight I say to the President: Mr. Bush, for 12 years you've had it your way.",
          "He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.",
          "We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.",
          "You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.",
          "Mr. Stone, I've had to make thousands of decisions since I've been President, serving in the Oval Office.",
          "And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.",
          "Mr. President, let me finish.",
          "The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress.",
          "But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made.",
          "I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well.",
          "And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan.",
          "You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.",
          "That's what a President's for.",
          "I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.",
          "I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.",
          "And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered.",
          "As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I've got a pen.",
          "This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.",
          "Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.",
          "That I can get something positive done on behalf of the people.",
          "I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.",
          "Well, John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years.",
          "Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: \"The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership.\"",
          "Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make.",
          "Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.",
          "And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.",
          "President Clinton did the same thing, because we have an obligation to protect you.",
          "We've got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do, so you can make a judgment.",
          "And so will the former President, yes.",
          "He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.",
          "Colin Powell will be on somebody's ticket 4 years from now -- right?",
          "That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.",
          "You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President.",
          "And they really matter when you are president.",
          "Now, this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press, when I am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there?",
          "I'm pleased the president made the decision he made.",
          "Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?",
          "I want to move forward, I want this nation to move forward.",
          "But in my view, the president should have grabbed it.",
          "I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.",
          "I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way.",
          "I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.",
          "I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.",
          "I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.",
          "I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it's nowhere near enough.",
          "First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.",
          "That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President.",
          "That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.",
          "Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation.",
          "I don't think a president can unilaterally overturn it.",
          "But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.",
          "We're talking about 2 weeks from now you've gotta decide who's gonna be president.",
          "And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.",
          "But I don't believe this president can.",
          "And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.",
          "It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations.",
          "A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power.",
          "I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.",
          "In 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century.",
          "And, above all, I want a nation that's strong.",
          "The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.",
          "And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president.",
          "Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day.",
          "He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.",
          "There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers.",
          "I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when I'm in Washington every morning, talking about how to protect us.",
          "But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.",
          "And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.",
          "President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.",
          "I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears.",
          "At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it'll take 13 years to get it.",
          "Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir.",
          "And we're going to stay engaged, as long as I'm president, working to improve things.",
          "Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.",
          "I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and we're making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there.",
          "That crime bill is going to be one of my highest priorities next January if I become president.",
          "You know, the President reminds me sometimes of my brother Kenny, who is no longer alive.",
          "Let me just take two seconds of my time because I'm the Commander-in-Chief to respond to one thing that was said.",
          "Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that.",
          "I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.",
          "And if he should ever become uh - the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States.",
          "Obviously the president and I both have very strong convictions.",
          "But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.",
          "Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights.",
          "It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.",
          "And he will not advise me in the White House.",
          "Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully.",
          "You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.",
          "But the next President of the United States will have to make some tough and difficult decisions.",
          "But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.",
          "My whole administration is about your future.",
          "And first let me say that our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time, and I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions.",
          "And I ask you for the privilege of leading our nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world.",
          "Sometimes they don't like the decisions made by America, but I don't think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.",
          "It will work, and when it does work, Mr. President, I know you'll congratulate me.",
          "And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.",
          "I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.",
          "The president's done nothing to try to fix it.",
          "That happened before you came into office.",
          "First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America?",
          "... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America.",
          "This is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when I'm president.",
          "And, incidentally, may I say that that's the decision of the Congress, and the president has concurred.",
          "... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.",
          "That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.",
          "I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the president did a terrific job.",
          "But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.",
          "I've made that clear throughout my presidency.",
          "There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.",
          "For the last two years, I've been the president, and I have found from experience that it's much more difficult to make those decisions than it is to second-guess them.",
          "If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children.",
          "But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.",
          "Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.",
          "I'm running to get some things done for America.",
          "And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just don't do it.",
          "I hope I've earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character.",
          "But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.",
          "And believe me, if you knew my family and if you knew the private life I have, you would agree in a minute that that's a whole lot more fun than getting involved in politics.",
          "I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.",
          "That's what President Clinton did.",
          "The first thing I'd do is, during political campaigns, I would urge everybody to stop trying to split this country into fragments and appeal to the differences between us and then wonder why the melting pot is all broken to pieces after November the 3rd.",
          "Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.",
          "Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we're going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we're investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.",
          "The president's terms are limited to 2, a total of 8 years.",
          "If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still won't be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe.",
          "And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.",
          "And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.",
          "Certainly the President of the United States, the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier.",
          "This president and his administration have told you and all of us it's not a question of when, it's a question of -- excuse me -- not a question of if, it's a question of when.",
          "Donald doesn't agree with that.",
          "And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.",
          "I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.",
          "That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves.",
          "I think whoever is in the White House should just make it absolutely unconscionable and inexcusable, and if anybody's in the middle of a speech at, you know, one of these conventions, I would expect the candidate to go out and lift him off the stage if he starts preaching hate -- because we don't have time for it.",
          "And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come.",
          "But, look, the nature of the challenges that we're going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it's never the challenges that you expect.",
          "That will change when I'm president of the United States.",
          "The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.",
          "But let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with.",
          "If I become president, I'll get America working again.",
          "But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.",
          "I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney.",
          "I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.",
          "And unfortunately again I regret this administration has not seized them and embraced them.",
          "Question really is who do you want in the White House.",
          "If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers?",
          "I'm in public service because I love this country.",
          "People look to the President of the United States more than any other person in America.",
          "And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, \"Let the inspectors work, or let's, you know, hope to talk him out.",
          "Every President until this one has been able to do it, and this nation -- or the world is more dangerous as a result.",
          "I will have a unique mandate.",
          "I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy.",
          "But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.",
          "And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.",
          "Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.",
          "If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.",
          "He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land.",
          "I agree with the general statement Mr. Bush made.",
          "And I'm glad that we have a good director in George Bush.",
          "And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly.",
          "Ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you he'd plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us.",
          "But I'll tell you this: As president, I'll never take my eye off that ball.",
          "I don't think that's the role of the president.",
          "I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right.",
          "And the president chose the wrong way.",
          "And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States.",
          "And -- and the -- and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.",
          "I have made myself at least ten uh - speeches in various parts of the country where I have discussed with the American people defense and foreign policy.",
          "I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do.",
          "But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people - what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom.",
          "We started from the day we got into office.",
          "That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.",
          "People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life.",
          "I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.",
          "I've been President now for almost four years.",
          "Because that's the way we elect a president in this country, and it's the way we should.",
          "Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.",
          "As president, I will make certain we travel it.",
          "Values begin at the top, in the White House.",
          "The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.",
          "And I have been a secretary of state...",
          "The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force.",
          "Let me tell you a little what it's like to be president.",
          "You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.",
          "So that's what I'll do as president.",
          "I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.",
          "We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president.",
          "A president should be the same thing to all people.",
          "But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right.",
          "When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it.",
          "Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons.",
          "Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make.",
          "I will have an ethical office in the White House that will be under the President's personal concern.",
          "If I'm elected we won't have Obama.",
          "I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.",
          "It's been very strong since I've been president.",
          "And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?",
          "I won't, I never repeat what I've talked to the President about.",
          "And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.",
          "But here again, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.",
          "But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.",
          "The president and I have always agreed on that.",
          "What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.",
          "Can you add five seconds, Bernie, out of fairness?",
          "That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.",
          "And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world.",
          "Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense.",
          "Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president's answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years.",
          "And I will be a good president.",
          "But I respect the presidency.",
          "And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.",
          "I have devoted 24 years of my life to public service and I've said this before and I'll say it again, if you entrust me with the presidency, I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will work hard for you every day.",
          "I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.",
          "And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.",
          "Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didn't level with you right now again.",
          "I would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasn't.",
          "But what I will also tell you is, look, I mean, when it comes to whether President Trump should serve or not, I trust the American people let them vote, let them decide.",
          "And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.",
          "And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President.",
          "I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.",
          "That's what I've been critical about the administration for.",
          "You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators.",
          "And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.",
          "In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as someone who's very different than who I am.",
          "I don't think that's the role of the president to pick you're right and you're not right.",
          "A shameless plug there, Mr. President.",
          "The president says I've changed my mind.",
          "Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace.",
          "And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.",
          "You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.",
          "But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all.",
          "You can't -- but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.",
          "Mr. President, I'd like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I'll go on to another question.",
          "He talks about a grand idea: Let's have a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit.",
          "That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.",
          "This is how Donald thinks.",
          "And those are the people that I will appoint.",
          "But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.",
          "And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.",
          "And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.",
          "I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who's run for president this year.",
          "Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.",
          "We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case.",
          "We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations.",
          "And when I am president, I'm going to do it because we have to.",
          "If I'm entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make.",
          "What's a question I think the -- the president will have a chance to answer right now.",
          "Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends try to make a big deal out of it.",
          "I know the President's supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what he's saying, with what I have said or what my positions are.",
          "He's going to do -- and he would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.",
          "The president stood right here in this hall four years ago, and he was asked a question by somebody just like you, \"Under what circumstances would you send people to war?\"",
          "But in the presidency, a lot goes into it.",
          "I was opposed to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it.",
          "And I'm going to act responsibly, as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate.",
          "And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.",
          "So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.",
          "That's unacceptable for us, and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.",
          "But let me tell you where the president's policies have put us.",
          "A President must know the essential facts essential to command.",
          "The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.",
          "Let's come back to what the president was speaking about, which is what's happening in the world and the president's statement that things are going so well.",
          "It's far better for a person sitting in the White House uh - who has a number of options to make certain that the uh - other side, so to speak, doesn't know precisely what you're going to do.",
          "I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.",
          "And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected.",
          "No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully.",
          "And the President, Mr. Mondale, has called you whining and vacillating, among the more charitable phrases -- weak, I believe.",
          "The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind.",
          "Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.",
          "All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.",
          "Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.",
          "Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make.",
          "Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved.",
          "People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.",
          "But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation.",
          "Ross, that's a great speech, but it's not quite that simple.",
          "I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country.",
          "I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.",
          "And we have General Flynn.",
          "But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.",
          "But no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh - decision might be or what option he might exercise.",
          "He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom.",
          "I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.",

          "Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president.",
          "Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.",

          "Mr. President, you're batting 0 for 2.",
          "And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.",
          "We're not going to do that in my administration.",
          "Step one, the American people send me up there, the day after election, I'll get with congressional--we won't even wait till inauguration, and I'll ask the president to help me and I'll ask his staff to help me.",

          "A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on.",
          "And that's the difference between the president and me.",
          "What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.",
          "He puts his money in the outyears, and even if he were re-elected, he'd be gone before anything would happen, and nothing is going to happen.",

          "Then the president, in fact, promised them.",
          "What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake.",
          "What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution.",
          "And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.",
          "The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.",

          "The president hasn't put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems.",
          "So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.",
          "It's the hardest decision a president makes.",
          "I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he's sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn't believe in checks and balances, and I told him that.",
          "That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there'll be no time for staffing committees or advisers.",

          "And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, \"Go out and shop.\"",
          "But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people.",
          "And we've watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table.",
          "But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.",
          "Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival.",
          "I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.",
          "And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.",
          "That's not going to happen, so long as I'm your president.",
          "But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that don't change - those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world.",
          "I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.",
          "So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.",
          "Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let's look at the record.",
          "And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world.",
          "How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?",
          "It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that God's given us in the greatest nation on earth - the United States.",
          "Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job.",
          "I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. \"",

          "And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.",
          "I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker.",
          "Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years.",
          "And Donald knows a lot about this.",
          "This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.",
          "Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.",
          "I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.",
          "But the point is, that - that a president ought to lead this country.",
          "I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.",
          "And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.",
          "But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.",
          "The president said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the U.N. and go to war as a last resort.",
          "Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.",
          "I was the first United States president to visit Japan.",
          "But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country.",
          "When I came into office, the world was divided.",
          "Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.",
          "But the president just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, \"Nope.",
          "The president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.",
          "Words matter when you run for president.",
          "He's extending the Administration's commitment.",
          "And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.",
          "And as president of the United States, that's what I will attempt to do, notwithstanding that -- we're going to be more division after he's defeated by me this next time.",
          "So, when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour.",
          "A president can't do that.",
          "We've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose as president.",
          "He's 3 years into this administration.",
          "I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose.",
          "And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.",
          "I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.",
          "The president said he would.",
          "I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.",
          "I think it's whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the people's ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think it's a question of values, not likability or loveability, it's a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because you'd know exactly how to begin.",
          "I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people.",
          "And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth.",
          "As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration.",
          "But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society.",
          "Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.",
          "Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.",
          "I'm telling you, I will make it the -- I will make the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform bill the very first measure that I send to the Congress as president.",
          "And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.",
          "A President is called the Commander in Chief.",
          "I know the President's been puffing a lot on that.",
          "This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself.",
          "I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it.",
          "It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to.",
          "In other words, a President has to make choices.",
          "Keep my promises to the American people.",
          "We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.",
          "President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.",
          "And Donald never tells you what he would do.",
          "That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.",
          "I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table.",
          "The President didn't have much to do about it.",
          "If I'm president in the United States, we'll get fair consideration of any pardon request.",
          "They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.",
          "And I have worked and I admire President Obama.",
          "And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief.",
          "I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.",
          "When you come out in 2014, I presume I'm going to be president.",
          "President Obama has moved millions of people out.",
          "They'll do fine whether you're president or I am.",
          "If I get elected, I'm not gonna - I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president.",
          "That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.",
          "And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.",
          "And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.",
          "He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.",
          "But I will never turn over our national- security decisions to leaders of other countries.",
          "This is a decision that the president of the United States must make.",
          "Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind.",
          "But if you're a president, it's not.",
          "Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule.",
          "But let me just address what the president just said.",
          "I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House.",
          "I made that clear when I came into office.",
          "Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies.",
          "Mr. President, you measure it by whether you're getting the job done.",
          "That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.",
          "And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States.",
          "And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.",
          "And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.",
          "So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November.",
          "If you want me to be your president, we're going to face our problems.",
          "And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.",
          "And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.",
          "I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise.",
          "I will work with Republicans and Democrats.",
          "A President must know right then.",
          "I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president.",
          "And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.",
          "And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary.",
          "will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States.",
          "I will be a president for all of our people.",
          "It's a good package, Mr. President.",
          "And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.",
          "Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.",
          "This has hurt this country, and a President's supposed to command.",
          "Let me mention something else the president said.",
          "That's been one of the hallmarks of my administration.",
          "I'm the first president ever to allow funding -- federal funding -- for embryonic stem-cell research.",
          "But I am discussing the power the President has to grant pardons.",
          "Once again, the president is misleading America.",
          "It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats, let's come together to do what is right for America.",
          "But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin it's going to take at least the first year of the new administration.",
          "Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.",
          "But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.",
          "A president sets the strategy and relies upon good military people to execute that strategy.",
          "Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.",
          "The person responsible for domestic economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton.",
          "The president has term limits.",
          "And I don't think anybody has a call on people in their Administrations going astray.",
          "So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.",
          "He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.",
          "I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.",
          "He wants you to believe that I can't be president.",
          "And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.",
          "This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level.",
          "I said I would have the Secretary of Defense sit down.",
          "Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?",
          "Now, the president said, \"I'm not blocking that.\"",
          "I have to pay the administration a compliment.",
          "And the president should lead a national effort to change behavior, to keep our children alive in the schools, responsible behavior to keep people alive.",
          "I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.",
          "This is a responsibility of the president.",
          "And I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election.",
          "Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.",
          "And I intend to win it as President of the United States.",
          "But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.",
          "I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.",
          "And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down.",
          "What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?",
          "I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we're glad to have a comparison with the previous administration.",
          "We've done that by executive order.",
          "Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him.",
          "In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.",
          "I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.",
          "Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index.",
          "He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.",
          "Well, the president and his experts have told America that it's not a question of if; it's a question of when.",
          "To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.",
          "You got to send down some more people, because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property.",
          "It doesn't work that way when you're president.",
          "But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.",
          "I support the President's position.",
          "If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it.",
          "I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble.",
          "We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.",
          "What I'm going to do is say to Jim Baker when this campaign is over, all right, let's sit down now, you do in domestic affairs what you've done in foreign affairs, be kind of the economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the House, and that includes all the economic side, all the training side, and bring this program together.",
          "I've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first.",
          "I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.",
          "For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.",
          "It's one of the major priorities of my administration.",
          "A President must know these things.",
          "I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.",
          "I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs.",
          "But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.",
          "John, you heard the president just say that he thought he might try to be for it.",
          "That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.",
          "What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.",
          "And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but you've got to, as president, you can't be on all these different sides, and you can't have this pattern of saying well, I did this or I didn't, then the facts come out and you change it.",
          "And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that.",
          "But that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it.",
          "And as president, I am committed to changing that.",
          "But I would not want anyone to elect me uh - president of the United States - or vote for me - under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected.",
          "We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.",
          "It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.",
          "If the uh - list was, uh - in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it.",
          "I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate.",
          "Ross gave a good answer but I've got to respond directly to Mr. Bush.",
          "Well, Mr. Carter has uh indicated that uh - he would give a blanket pardon to all uh - draft evaders.",
          "But I would not, I would not meet with -- absent preconditions, I would not meet with the, quote, Supreme Leader, who said Joe Biden is a rabid dog, he should be beaten to death with a stick.",
          "I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.",
          "But this president hasn't even held the kind of statesman-like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states.",
          "I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded.",
          "You know, four years ago, I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president.",
          "Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.",
          "I happen to like President Clinton personally.",
          "And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.",
          "I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.",
          "And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.",
          "A President must know those things.",
          "We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.",
          "That's the decision of the next president of the United States.",
          "So, as president, would I use force?",
          "I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.",
          "Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that.",
          "That's my difference with the President.",
          "The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process.",
          "And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: \"Well, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow.\"",
          "We're not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.",
          "My record on world affairs is pretty well known because I've been president for 4 years, so I feel I've been talking issues.",
          "The president mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis.",
          "And when I'm president, I will.",
          "Of course the president will take credit for that.",
          "But I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way.",
          "I've got an agenda that I want to get done for the country.",
          "Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism.",
          "My -- my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.",
          "Mr. Bush talked about values.",
          "That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.",
          "We'd have won what Bill Clinton won.",
          "Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.",
          "That's what my mission will be in the presidency.",
          "The president has never said whether or not he would do that.",
          "It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.",
          "You can't do that as president.",
          "And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service.",
          "As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.",
          "Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.",
          "It's not about President Clinton.",
          "Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.",
          "And are you prepared to repudiate him now?",
          "Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run.",
          "If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.",
          "We can't impose it, but we need to nourish it and that's the kind of thing that I would do as president -- follow those three commitments into the future.",
          "The President has asked for my advice.",
          "It is a question of which administration does the right thing.",
          "See, the subjective thing is when does President Bush react?",
          "And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.",
          "And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.",
          "The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.",
          "Clearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it.",
          "But I am asking for your help and assistance to be president for the next four years.",
          "And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side.",
          "I didn't say 'I'm Abraham Lincoln'.",
          "Now again, the White House is a bully pulpit.",
          "I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto.",
          "I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that.",
          "I'll have an administration that will make you proud.",
          "I'll be a president for Democrats and Republicans.",
          "I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.",
          "And that's what I intend to do as president.",
          "The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.",
          "No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.",
          "I don't disagree with anything that the President said, except he waited four years to do these things, and my view is it ought to be, it will be done on Day 1.",
          "I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president.",
          "To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.",
          "But unfortunately, President Trump has made it much harder for the next president to achieve that goal.",
          "I see that as part of my job as president, and I'll make my best effort to do it.",
          "So here's what I've done since I've been president.",
          "But this president didn't try to fix it.",
          "Obama draws the line in the sand.",
          "Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.",
          "But history will look back, and I'm fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration, because the president makes the decisions, the president has to take the responsibility.",
          "And what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit?",
          "And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people.",
          "When you're president you expect this.",
          "There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.",
          "And that's why I'll be a better commander in chief.",
          "I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country.",
          "When I'm President of the United States, I will keep my word.",
          "A President can't know everything, but a President has to know those things that are essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our laws.",
          "There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I've been open, candid and forthright.",
          "First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.",
          "A president can't be all things to all people.",
          "And when I am president, anytime -- which I hope will never happen -- but anytime I am compelled to use force and seek that authorization, we will have a three-year sunset, so that the American people are included ...",
          "But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.",
          "I won't hold it against him that he went to Yale.",
          "If the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders, say, \"What do you need, what do you need now, how much more will it take to get you to join us?\"",
          "Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.",
          "And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored.",
          "Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.",
          "And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.",
          "But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued."

          "In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.",
          "But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I'm not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that.",
          "Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy.",
          "And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.",
          "I never got any money from Russia.",
          "In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union.",
          "And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.",
          "He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that's why his proposal didn't work.",
          "And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.",
          "The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff.",
          "The present leadership uh - there is uh - is fairly uniform in - in their purpose, and I think it's a close-knit group, uh - and uh - I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing.",
          "But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.",
          "Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.",
          "Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?",
          "First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets.",
          "Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.",
          "Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space.",
          "It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.",
          "The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point.",
          "We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites.",
          "There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia.",
          "I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.",
          "We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there.",
          "And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.",
          "I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.",
          "Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.",
          "First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time.",
          "Of course I -- I don't know Putin.",
          "I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.",
          "The Russians can't believe it.",
          "The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they've been getting it.",
          "I'm not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment.",
          "The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world.",
          "But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.",
          "At the same time, we have to make certain that the Soviet Union's Backfire, which they claim is not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend is, must also be included if we are to get the kind of agreement which is in the best interest of both countries.",
          "I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.",
          "If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.",
          "I have seen Communism abroad.",
          "That's an area where we're going to have to work with Russia.",
          "I have no loans from Russia.",
          "He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.",
          "In the first place, never go back to that Democratic grain embargo, that liberal Democrat grain embargo that knocked the markets right out from under us and made Mr. Gorbachev say to me when I was here, how do I know you're reliable suppliers?",
          "Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.",
          "I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took.",
          "It's not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.",
          "Ukraine, right now, is in the sights of Vladimir Putin, those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union.",
          "I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.",
          "You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavia's dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isn't going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and I'm not going to do that as commander-in-chief.",
          "Under this administration we've had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other.",
          "And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path.",
          "Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.",
          "When I say \"phony spirit,\" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say.",
          "Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity.",
          "If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.",
          "We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.",
          "You see the turmoil in Poland today.",
          "But they didn't have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better.",
          "That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.",
          "She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.",
          "And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.",
          "Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.",
          "Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now.",
          "Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency.",
          "We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.",
          "I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.",
          "I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country - a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands - we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens.",
          "And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.",
          "It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.",
          "And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.",
          "National security, economic strength, democracy.",
          "Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something.",
          "I know nothing about Russia.",
          "And at his pace, it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia.",
          "The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics.",
          "He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia.",
          "First of all, as I say, I don't think that -- we're not going to have another Cold War with Russia.",
          "All they've got to show for 4 years in U.S.-Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration, and nothing before.",
          "The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system.",
          "Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin.",
          "First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.",
          "They are members of NATO.",
          "Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.",
          "There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up.",
          "But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them.",
          "Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.",
          "He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia.",
          "And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil.",
          "That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela.",
          "The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.",
          "By Russia or anybody else.",
          "When I was at the U.N., the Russian ambassador suddenly died.",
          "Under this administration we've also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts.",
          "Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.",
          "And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.",
          "In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire - their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft.",
          "But the Russians, I think we can deal with them but they've got to understand that they're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world.",
          "That's why it's important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic.",
          "We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform.",
          "The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.",
          "And I went to Ukraine, because I wanted to see for myself, what Vladimir Putin's army was doing to the free Ukrainian people.",
          "Depends on how we respond to Russia and it depends on a lot of things.",
          "In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.",
          "And one last point I want to make about Russia.",
          "Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.",
          "So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.",
          "Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.",
          "Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin.",
          "Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.",
          "She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.",
          "We ought to pursue strategies with each of them, economic and the rest, that help them pull away from their dependence upon the Soviet Union.",
          "Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate.",
          "I don't trust the Russians.",
          "And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that's why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.",
          "Well, it's cost-effective to help Russia succeed in its revolution; it's pennies on the dollar compared to going back to the Cold War.",
          "I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world.",
          "The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia.",
          "And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.",
          "And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line.",
          "The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn't sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.",
          "I don't make money from Russia.",
          "If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, Iraq - If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician.",
          "And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem.",
          "But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.",
          "As George Will said the other day, \"Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now.\"",
          "And the Russians need to understand that.",
          "And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire.",
          "But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.",
          "I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.",

          "I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.",
          "We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.",
          "Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia.",
          "Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh - who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, they'll be persuaded to follow our example.",
          "Well, I was interested in Senator Obama's reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia.",
          "Well, I think that, given what's happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region.",
          "But take Russia, for example.",
          "The Freedom Support Act is something I got through the Congress, and it's a very good thing, because it does exactly what you say, and I think you agree with that, to help Russian democracy.",
          "We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.",
          "Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.",
          "Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse.",
          "I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.",
          "Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.",
          "I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.",
          "I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be.",
          "And we are driving Russia further into China's arms.",
          "The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe - Radio - uh- uh - Radio Free Europe is being jammed.",
          "I don't believe, uh - Mr. Frankel that uh - the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.",
          "Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.",
          "... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.",
          "Because the only type of agreements to reach with the Soviet Union are the types that are specifically defined, so we know exactly what they must do; subject to full verification, which means we know every day whether they're living up to it; and followups, wherever we find suggestions that they're violating it; and the strongest possible terms.",
          "That was a great doctrine throughout the Cold War.",
          "But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.",
          "We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.",
          "But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.",
          "I'd love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.",
          "And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.",
          "I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...",
          "You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.",
          "We've got to show moral support for Ukraine.",
          "When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues.",
          "And that wasn't just about a problem between Georgia and Russia.",
          "But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union.",
          "But I have no loans with Russia.",
          "We said, \"Peace through strength,\" and it worked and the cold war is over.",
          "I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.",
          "But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we've made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe.",
          "How did we get on to Putin?",
          "And today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense - just working people who believe in me - spread around the country uh - involved in the political campaign.",
          "I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement.",
          "But the president's been slow to do that, even in Russia.",
          "I don't believe that the Rumanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.",
          "Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, \"Now, are you willing to join us?",
          "I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a \"K,\" a \"G,\" and a \"B.\"",
          "And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War.",
          "I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.",
          "I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.",
          "I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.",
          "There's another, a similar issue out there that relates to your -- it is said, at least, that you were unaware that the Soviet retaliatory power was based on land-based missiles.",
          "We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us.",
          "... with the Russians and other foreign powers.",
          "When we think of Russia, remember we're thinking of many countries, now.",
          "And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.",
          "But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.",
          "I don't want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets.",
          "Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.",
          "So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory."

          "You know, if they asked me to be part of some monitoring force -- as we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 -- to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel, frankly, I would have to think about it.",

          "So, what -- what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map.",
          "Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.",
          "I'm going to stand by Israel.",
          "Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies.",

          "But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.",
          "And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.",

          "And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas.",
          "And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.",
          "It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel.",
          "... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.",
          "And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.",

          "Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.",

          "But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.",
          "It's also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we're now in.",
          "But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.",
          "And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.",
          "And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror.",
          "Is this a war-torn country?",
          "We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of America's assets.",
          "We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.",
          "And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen.",

          "He won't use the term \"radical Islamic terrorism.\"",
          "And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.",
          "I think he said that Israel was a - a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire.",
          "And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror.",

          "Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.",
          "We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.",
          "I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?",
          "What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon.",

          "Recognize -- I believe that Assad must go.",
          "And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.",
          "This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.",
          "But the Saudi's and the Qatari, and -- and the Turks are all very concerned about this.",
          "And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.",
          "We organized the Friends of Syria.",
          "But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.",
          "Israel is our friend and we'll stand by Israel.",
          "I will knock the hell out of ISIS.",
          "And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.",
          "And I don't believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews.",
          "We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.",
          "We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we're seeing them.",
          "And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East.",
          "I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where there's a genocide, where our national security is at stake there.",
          "Take a look at Aleppo.",
          "All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that.",
          "The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.",
          "If we tried everything else, if we have allies.",
          "Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.",
          "We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East.",
          "Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.",

          "It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.",
          "You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.",
          "First of all, when we and our allies -- the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government.",
          "And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel.",
          "I don't want to have our military involved in Syria.",
          "After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded.",

          "She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.",
          "The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.",
          "It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank, and I believe if the parties will get together and in a good-faith manner make that agreement, that they'll be able to do it if we cannot impose a peace on the Middle East.",
          "And this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East.",
          "And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.",
          "And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.",
          "Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.",
          "When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.",
          "It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.",
          "I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.",
          "You don't even know who the rebels are.",
          "I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.",
          "But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.",
          "What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open.",
          "With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to -- to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.",
          "Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.",
          "When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying we don't want to abandon the peace process.",
          "I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation's interests.",
          "We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.",
          "We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East.",
          "Syria -- Syria's not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic -- strategically significant player for America.",

          "Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.",
          "We need to reach out to moderate Arab nations as well to build coalitions to keep the peace.",
          "We don't know who the rebels are.",
          "But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.",
          "I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.",
          "I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they're rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there.",

          "You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.",
          "If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.",
          "Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker.",
          "They are plotting to kill Americans right now.",
          "They would establish a base in Iraq.",
          "We have made available to the Israelis over 45 percent of the total economic and military aid since the establishment of Israel twenty-seven years ago.",
          "And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.",
          "A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.",
          "It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.",
          "Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon.",
          "And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.",
          "Is -- are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?",
          "And, as well, we're pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror.",
          "They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we've been focused on Iraq.",
          "I would not ship that Arab country anything - no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing.",
          "Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.",
          "I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.",
          "We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.",
          "But what I've also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities.",
          "Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.",
          "I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.",
          "Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.",
          "And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.",
          "You know, I've made some decisions on Israel that's unpopular.",
          "Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.",
          "But time is our friend there, because their leaders will change in not too many years, worst case, and their country is making great progress.",
          "I'm going to get it right for those soldiers, because it's important to Israel, it's important to America, it's important to the world, it's important to the fight on terror.",
          "A free Iraq will help secure Israel.",
          "But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria.",
          "So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.",
          "And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort.",
          "Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if I'm President of the United States, when I'm President of the United States, we will stand with Israel.",
          "Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.",
          "And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.",

          "Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.",
          "Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation.",
          "We are not dependent upon the Middle East.",
          "I believe Palestinians ought to have a state, but I know they need leadership that's committed to a democracy and freedom, leadership that would be willing to reject terrorism.",
          "And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace.",
          "And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.",
          "With all this instability and breaking into republics, and all the Middle Eastern countries going over there and shopping for weapons, we've got our work cut out for us.",
          "They have been our friend since their inception as a nation.",
          "And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.",
          "We are not at war with Islam.",
          "The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies.",
          "I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying.",
          "I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.",
          "Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground.",
          "There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process.",
          "But next door, of course, we have Egypt.",
          "But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.",
          "And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.",
          "... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse.",
          "What message does that send the Iraqis?",
          "The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down.",
          "But what's been happening over the last couple of years is, as we've watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in.",
          "She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.",
          "We must never waver in the face of this enemy that -- these ideologues of hate.",
          "We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the -- the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is -- it's certainly not on the run.",
          "The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh - influence and power in the Middle East.",
          "And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.",
          "What Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a \"stinking corpse,\" and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments.",
          "And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel.",
          "You've got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons.",
          "We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down.",
          "No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.",
          "The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...",
          "And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.",
          "We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.",
          "Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region.",
          "What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?",
          "Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way.",
          "Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.",
          "We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East: It is to support the peace process; to support the security of Israel; and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace.",
          "But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.",
          "Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust.",
          "I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.",
          "So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.",
          "But -- but I can say this, that we're talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism we're seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and -- and confusion.",
          "And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a -- in a form of -- if not government, a form of -- of -- of council that can take the lead in Syria.",
          "Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.",
          "I wouldn't deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I don't think he's the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state.",
          "I think the first one was related to uh - the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and uh - in the Congress.",
          "Let's take the example of Darfur just for a moment.",
          "In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.",

          "The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and -- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.",
          "A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and that's essential.",
          "There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.",
          "But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.",
          "Now, on the Middle East, as you know, I worked very hard for peace in the Middle East.",
          "That's a classic example of a strategy that's embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.",
          "And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.",
          "All over the world, people are being torn apart -- Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi -- you name it -- because of all their differences.",
          "Is the Middle East in tumult?",
          "You cannot make concessions to terrorists.",
          "Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there.",
          "And -- and they're throughout many nations in the Middle East.",
          "I went to Yad Beshef (ph), the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.",
          "And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.",
          "But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing.",
          "I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace.",
          "So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and we're dedicated to the survival and security of Israel.",
          "I -- I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate.",
          "Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.",
          "But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.",
          "We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.",
          "I can say this: I do not believe Yassir Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank.",
          "But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement.",
          "We can't put the Middle East peace process on our timetable.",
          "And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.",
          "And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.",
          "That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.",
          "And Assad -- excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we're going to try to have a ceasefire.",
          "You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program.",
          "I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters.",
          "And there's going to be an Arab summit, of the neighborhood countries.",
          "It's the US that's taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia.",

          "My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.",
          "And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.",
          "They're interested in keeping Assad in power.",
          "The Philippines -- we've got help -- we're helping them there to bring -- to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there.",
          "This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a -- a complete change in the -- the structure and the -- the environment in the Middle East.",
          "We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.",
          "Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens.",
          "The United Nations, Kofi Annan offered help after Baghdad fell.",
          "That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.",
          "And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn't have long-term designs on it.",
          "And we've had many successful Muslims.",
          "Well, let's step back and talk about what's happening in Syria and how important it is.",
          "And Prime Minister Koizumi is going to call countries to account, to get them to contribute.",
          "We don't know who the rebels are.",
          "You take a look at Mosul.",
          "And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference.",
          "Take a look at the Middle East.",
          "Well, Aleppo is a disaster.",
          "Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.",
          "So that's how I've used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region.",
          "But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future.",
          "I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East.",
          "Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists.",
          "That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.",
          "We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.",
          "And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.",
          "I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there.",
          "And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us.",
          "I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.",
          "This -- what we're seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that's why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition.",
          "The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.",
          "And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.",
          "We want -- we want to make sure that we're seeing progress throughout the Middle East.",
          "They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.",
          "But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.",
          "I couldn't agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.",
          "And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history.",
          "And the main reason we'll succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free.",
          "And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.",
          "I'm not some extremist out here.",
          "It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.",

          "We're going to defeat ISIS.",
          "And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.",
          "I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.",
          "And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us.",
          "There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.",
          "And it's not only just America, but NATO is now helping, Jordan's helping train police, UAE is helping train police.",
          "I am concerned about ethnic cleansing.",
          "Whether it's Syria, you name it.",
          "Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?",
          "And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.",
          "Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.",
          "Also in 1975, we almost brought Israel to their knees after the uh - Yom Kippur War by the so-called reassessment of our relationship to Israel.",
          "It's a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East.",
          "But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.",
          "And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.",
          "And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders.",
          "The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.",
          "In fact, this week we'll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week.",
          "If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.",
          "And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists.",
          "Libya's 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population.",
          "First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster.",
          "This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we have done in the Middle East and throughout the world.",
          "We just heard the President's answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed.",
          "I think you have to knock out ISIS.",
          "They're a member of the axis of evil.",
          "And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.",
          "I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend.",
          "That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.",
          "And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein.",
          "And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.",
          "Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.",
          "Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election.",
          "People are going to come in from Syria.",
          "I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.",
          "And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.",
          "It's going to destabilize the Middle East.",
          "We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with -- with Israel.",
          "In dealing with terrorists, yes, we want to retaliate, but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating.",
          "We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.",
          "If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.",
          "After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement - and I'm proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.",
          "And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.",
          "I believe we have to get ISIS.",
          "Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence.",
          "And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.",
          "The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.",
          "We will take out ISIS.",
          "And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.",
          "In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.",
          "And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.",
          "I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult.",
          "Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there.",
          "He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume for the purpose of an - imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.",
          "And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.",
          "And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.",
          "And they're showing up in Iraq for the same reason.",
          "There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.",
          "And we have to recognize that the way they've been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.",
          "With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East."

          "In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.",
          "Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.",
          "For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core - below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh - power tightly sealed and a heavy - heavy vacuum maintained.",
          "Well, I can't say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff, but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.",
          "I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it.",
          "We didn't guard the nuclear facilities.",
          "I think we're going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
          "I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.",
          "And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty.",
          "It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons.",
          "I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes.",
          "I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon.",
          "We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.",
          "And that's where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off.",
          "Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace.",
          "... about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.",
          "We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy.",
          "And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based.",
          "And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China.",
          "There are limits to this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems.",
          "Like Kyoto Treaty would have done.",
          "That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.",
          "And the result was unilateral disarmament.",
          "There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.",
          "One last point on the missiles.",
          "We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.",
          "But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.",
          "This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.",
          "And then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles.",
          "But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.",
          "It's very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one.",
          "I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.",
          "The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction.",
          "And that's where the President's failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly.",
          "We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.",
          "We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest.",
          "I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.",
          "There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity - including Red China - by the end of the presidential office in 1964.",
          "And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.",
          "And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.",
          "No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.",
          "And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding.",
          "And -- and -- we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they -- they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.",
          "We have to have nuclear power.",
          "Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.",
          "We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction.",
          "And the biggest threat facing America is terrorists with weapons of mass destruction.",
          "You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were.",
          "That's one major war explosion in a warhead.",
          "We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.",
          "And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.",
          "Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, Ã¢â€°Â¥Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place.Ã¢â€°Â¤ He hasn't told us where.",
          "I've been fighting for proliferation the entire time -- anti-proliferation the entire time I've been in the Congress.",
          "What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world.",
          "The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium.",
          "But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.",
          "And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it.",
          "It's important for the nuclear weapons.",
          "But I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack.",
          "When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.",
          "I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.",
          "In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.",
          "First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn't exist.",
          "If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn't be in the budget.",
          "So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.",
          "He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.",
          "The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.",
          "At his pace, it's going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.",
          "It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.",
          "When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business.",
          "We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States.",
          "Now, some people have said, \"Ah, that would make war imminent, because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy.''",
          "I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.",
          "And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.",
          "They will know whether we used those weapons or not.",
          "And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.",
          "Well, that's what a President's supposed to know -- where those weapons are going to be.",
          "I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail.",
          "The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.",
          "Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities.",
          "One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we'll get to later on because that is the most important single issue in this campaign.",
          "Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.",
          "Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.",
          "And that's something which will be a priority of ours in the new administration because without it, we cannot have the effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent we must have.",
          "Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.",
          "We've got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don't have those things put away yet.",
          "But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue.",
          "The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war.",
          "And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.",
          "And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.",
          "We'll make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.",
          "They're back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.",
          "They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed.",
          "And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.",
          "And thank God, it has, because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.",
          "Instead, I want to build the Midgetman, which is mobile and thus less vulnerable, contributing to stability, and a weapon that will give us security and contribute to an incentive for arms control.",
          "But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement to each one of them, and I'll repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.",
          "Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions, but it's going to be the President who's going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay.",
          "We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don't need, can't afford and won't help our defense posture at all.",
          "I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.",
          "The president is the one that said, \"We can't allow countries to get nuclear weapons.\"",
          "The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.",
          "I know that the CIA is already going forward with one.",
          "But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.",
          "If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.",
          "We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent.",
          "As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.",
          "What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?",
          "I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.",
          "Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.",
          "But when you keep star-warring it -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist.",
          "If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea.",
          "We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium.",
          "One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don't feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament.",
          "Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.",
          "Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea.",
          "I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.",
          "We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.",
          "And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon.",
          "They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.",

          "That wasn't proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense.",

          "But the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project.",

          "To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan.",
          "But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.",
          "A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.",
          "If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.",
          "I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth -- whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species.",
          "And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.",
          "Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris.",
          "But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.",
          "We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia.",
          "And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons.",
          "Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks.",
          "I wasn't happy when we found out there wasn't weapons, and we've got an intelligence group together to figure out why.",
          "First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing.",
          "This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.",
          "He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.",
          "And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command.",
          "In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction.",
          "War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.",
          "I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.",
          "Secondly, we've set up what's called the -- well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.",
          "And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.",
          "Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.",
          "I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.",
          "I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.",
          "Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent.",
          "Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust.",
          "What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.",
          "And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war.",
          "They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.",
          "It is important for NATO to have it work.",
          "An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons.",
          "Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation.",
          "But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history.",
          "Whenever a weapon is tested we count the number of warheads on it, and whenever that warhead is used we count that number of warheads, whether they have that number or less on it, or not.",
          "And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.",
          "Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.",
          "And what we need to do is not meetings, not press releases, because something that would send a lot more than a press release is actually harpoon missiles.",
          "As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.",
          "If it hadn't been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he'd have nuclear weapons.",
          "There isn't any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let's have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven't been making an effort, he simply doesn't know what he's talking about.",
          "That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.",
          "And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.",
          "Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.",
          "We can work on nuclear power plants.",
          "This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.",
          "President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.",
          "He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobody's going to get hurt.",
          "Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.",
          "Actually, we've increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I've been the president.",
          "And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.",
          "And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.",
          "And Senator Obama says he's for nuclear, but he's against reprocessing and he's against storing.",
          "The Governor talks about limits, what we can't do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, we'll develop some new kind of a missile.",
          "They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they've got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida.",
          "And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other.",
          "We're going to go forward with the Stealth and the D-5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces."

          "And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward, when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long-term competitiveness.",
          "But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.",
          "We had an $800 billion deficit.",
          "You said you'd cut the deficit in half.",
          "I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.",
          "We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses.",
          "He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.",
          "I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home.",
          "But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.",
          "Like you, I'm concerned about the deficit.",
          "And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.",
          "And when we talk about deficits, if we're adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don't need them, and we're cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race.",
          "I will pay down the national debt.",
          "One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we'd have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece.",
          "By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we're okay.",
          "Bringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive.",
          "And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 to 11 Eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down, so we're going to come right down to that one.",
          "It's causing high interest rates.",
          "Look, we've got the biggest surpluses in all of American history.",
          "I am the one person up here who has on her website in her plan a plan to actually start taking on the deficit, by taking part of that money from that corporate tax cut that they put in there and putting it in a fund to pay back the deficit.",
          "How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.",
          "It's not good to raise the deficit.",
          "The president thinks it's more important to fight for that top 1 percent than to fight for fiscal responsibility and to fight for you.",
          "Now if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt that's already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more, and if we continue with this for another four years, then I'm worried about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation around.",
          "Well, we're $4 trillion in debt.",
          "Do you know that we've laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China?",
          "Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too.",
          "The mistake that was made was making the \"read my lips\" promise in the first place just to get elected, knowing what the size of the deficit was.",
          "Former chief of the -- Joint Chiefs of Staff said that -- Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.",
          "That's why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America's exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children.",
          "Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.",
          "You've got a $260 billion deficit.",
          "We have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 % over the next 4 years, but first get incentives to invest in this economy, put the American people back to work.",
          "And we paid down the debt of our nation for two years in a row, and we created 23 million new jobs at the same time.",
          "Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now -- over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children?",
          "Credit card debt has never been higher.",
          "We've gotta get this country growing again and this economy strong again or we can't bring down the deficit.",
          "And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger.",
          "That's why I don't think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity.",
          "I do not add a penny to the national debt.",
          "Our long-term interest rates are still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance.",
          "When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion?",
          "We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit.",
          "The debt and the deficit.",
          "There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.",
          "I don't think the surplus is the government's money.",
          "They're half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they'll be a lot less.",
          "And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.",
          "When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.",
          "That's the way you bring a deficit down and help to improve the quality of life for people at the same time.",
          "I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility.",
          "Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.",
          "Now with respect to the deficit, the president was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen.",
          "Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.",
          "I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don't believe that you're going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three.",
          "Well, I'm a little confused here, because I don't see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people's taxes.",
          "It was $200 billion deficit instead.",
          "No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending",
          "And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it's attributable to the deficit.",
          "And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.",
          "And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.",
          "Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.",
          "This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.",
          "Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.",
          "We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, \"Well, you know what?",
          "We owe China $500 billion.",
          "I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.",
          "And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.",
          "And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.",
          "And I think we'll have some decrease in our disbursements.",
          "You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you're paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount.",
          "That is the same old argument that's gotten us into trouble on the deficit side.",
          "We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.",
          "And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.",
          "Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus.",
          "My opponent thinks the government -- the surplus is the government's money.",
          "Now, for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, you're going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton, when people made a lot of money.",
          "We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.",
          "In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.",
          "He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years.",
          "Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.",
          "What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.",
          "So seventy percent of our debt is five years or less.",
          "The second biggest surplus next to Japan.",
          "When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me.",
          "And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country.",
          "So more debt and less jobs.",
          "Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.",
          "That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.",
          "So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.",
          "It does not put a deficit on the Treasury.",
          "But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.",
          "And so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history.",
          "And we've got to make sure that we reduce our deficit.",
          "Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses.",
          "Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.",
          "And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk.",
          "The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down.",
          "Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.",
          "We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978.",
          "It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.",
          "Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.",
          "We've gone from $10 trillion of national debt, to $16 trillion of national debt.",
          "The connection that's been made again between the deficit and the interest rates -- there is no connection between them.",
          "But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh - add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector - not make jobs, where the jobs really are.",
          "When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses.",
          "If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.",
          "We still have trillion-dollar deficits.",
          "If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation.",
          "Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.",
          "Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.",
          "Knowing what the size of the deficit was, knowing there was no plan to control health care costs and knowing that we did not have a strategy to get real economic growth back into this economy.",
          "We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is.",
          "I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.",
          "Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down.",
          "At least we have low interest rates that the Fed can control.",
          "We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.",
          "And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.",
          "The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history.",
          "But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates -- the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled -- and that's still the case today.",
          "You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.",
          "The president's spending, the president's borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people.",
          "And by two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits.",
          "I agree that the surplus is the American people's money, it's your money.",
          "Take, for example, Third World debt.",
          "Well, he mentioned the debt.",
          "And then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.",
          "We owe you a debt we can never repay you.",
          "We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.",
          "And we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations.",
          "Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.",
          "Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years.",
          "It's time to do it because we have run up so much debt that time is no longer our friend.",
          "When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent.",
          "I also will not add a penny to the debt.",
          "Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.",
          "See, we've got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less.",
          "They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.",
          "Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.",
          "That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.",
          "President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.",
          "If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them.",
          "But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.",
          "You call yourself the King of Debt.",
          "He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.",
          "When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.",
          "We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America.",
          "We're a serious debtor nation.",
          "I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt.",
          "I think they're better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down.",
          "You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.",
          "I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts.",
          "But everybody's affected by the debt because of the tremendous interest that goes into paying on that debt everything's more expensive.",
          "But what I've also said is, if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more.",
          "When the -- when the president of Iraq -- excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that's a frightening thing.",
          "But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.",
          "We have a budget deficit in the federal government, but we also have an investment, a jobs, an income deficit.",
          "I'm concerned about the fact that so many of our securities are in the hands of foreign banks because of these massive deficits.",
          "Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.",
          "I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years.",
          "It's a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.",
          "And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.",
          "Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in.",
          "And that drives our friends to the south up into our region, and we need to end those deficits as well.",
          "In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits -- there was nothing wrong with having deficits.",
          "Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.",
          "Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit.",
          "Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.",
          "And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually.",

          "We owe him a debt of gratitude.",
          "We know how to get control of the debt.",
          "And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.",
          "We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.",
          "They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.",
          "In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.",
          "We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.",
          "And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.",
          "Cutting 500,000 kids from after-school programs, cutting 365,000 kids from health care, running up the biggest deficits in American history.",
          "You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.",
          "And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.",
          "Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.",
          "Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt.",
          "We cut the deficit by 60 percent.",
          "Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?",
          "I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes.",
          "We went from deficit to surplus.",
          "And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work.",
          "Health care, schools--one on the debt and deficit.",
          "It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.",
          "The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.",
          "We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.",
          "And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children.",
          "How can we build a strong America militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt?",
          "And likewise you've got more and more debt on your back.",
          "He's added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together.",
          "We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office.",
          "We paid down the debt for two years.",
          "Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.",
          "This was not a way to pay down the deficit.",
          "But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.",
          "And, finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid to this country.",
          "The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.",
          "We have the highest foreign debt in history.",
          "It would borrow up to $3 trillion.",
          "Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.",
          "And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I'll put $2 toward paying down the national debt.",
          "I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade.",
          "And we're going to be fiscally responsible.",
          "And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.",
          "They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.",
          "And that's why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration.",
          "Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.",
          "And it's the president's fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history.",
          "Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.",
          "That's another reason to get the deficit down.",
          "We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials.",
          "No, but let me just stay to the American people in 2 and a half weeks we're going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down.",
          "But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich.",
          "And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.",
          "One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt?",
          "And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years.",
          "You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time.",
          "Well, my rebuttal is I've heard the national debt blamed for a lot of things, but not for illegal immigration across our border -- [laughter] -- and it has nothing to do with it.",
          "Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.",
          "We have a deficit because this country went into a recession.",
          "So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit.",
          "I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn't blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid in this country.",
          "When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion.",
          "This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.",
          "We've got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit's been reduced by 60 percent.",
          "Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy.",
          "If we're smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest.",
          "And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget.",
          "The president said he'd cut the deficit in half.",
          "But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.",
          "He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.",
          "So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.",
          "Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don't pay for money, you realize there's quite a spread, right, and you realize this is a temporary thing and there's going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof.",
          "If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt.",
          "There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil.",
          "Well, I mentioned Third World debt.",
          "They'll pay off our national debt.",
          "And my plan say why don't we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills?",
          "But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.",
          "We've got to reduce our deficit, but we've got to do it in a balanced way.",
          "And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.",
          "We can't afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse.",
          "That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh - we all know that it would've controlled our economy, it would've added uh - ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government.",
          "I think it's very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it.",
          "We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.",
          "Because we reduced the deficit four years in a row.",
          "We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.",
          "I think it's, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.",
          "What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.",
          "I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half.",
          "Our children will not see the American dream because of this debt that somebody somewhere dropped on us.",
          "And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years.",
          "The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists who've looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy.",
          "And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up.",
          "We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.",
          "I will pay down the debt every year.",
          "Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt?",
          "The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.",
          "I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people.",
          "We cannot pay off the $4 trillion debt, balance the budget and have the industries of the future and the high- paying jobs in this country without having the revenue.",
          "Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.",
          "That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.",
          "And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.",
          "And I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired.",
          "But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.",
          "We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates -- who remembers that?",
          "The deficit is the result of excessive government spending.",
          "Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.",
          "Surplus is money -- more money than needed.",
          "I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.",
          "And today it's less than 1 percent, because we're working together to try to bring this deficit under control.",
          "And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact.",
          "You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.",
          "Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.",
          "I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.",
          "And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.",
          "We've run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined.",
          "I think Mr. Perot has confronted this deficit issue, but I think it's important to point out that we really have 2 deficits in America, not one.",
          "But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you.",
          "When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.",
          "That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.",
          "They look at the fact that we owe 'em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that.",
          "Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future.",
          "For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets.",
          "The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.",
          "If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent -- we're not far from there -- by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level.",
          "We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.",
          "It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.",
          "I believe it's important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus.",
          "Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.",
          "You know, and everybody's ducking it so I'm gonna say it, that we are not letting that surplus stay in the bank.",
          "Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills.",
          "And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether it's Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is.",
          "That's what took us from surplus to deficit.",
          "When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion.",
          "The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years.",
          "And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.",
          "And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase.",
          "We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before.",
          "It would be squandered, too, believe me.",
          "Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.",
          "Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment.",
          "They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.",
          "That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt."

          "And did the person have full access to the courts of law?",
          "And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.",
          "Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.",
          "You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street.",
          "Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action.",

          "They went to extraordinary sick lengths, and I just found it amusing that they would take 2 or 3 cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator -- the lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common.",
          "We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.",
          "Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer.",
          "There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it's a shame it didn't pass, I think it should be made the law -- but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period.",
          "For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.",
          "I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.",

          "Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law.",
          "But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law.",
          "And so, we have to have respect for our justice system and the rule of law.",

          "There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.",

          "I'm also very tough on violent crime.",
          "I think they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe.",
          "But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.",

          "Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws.",
          "I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America.",
          "We - uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years.",
          "It's because of the work that we have done facing some of the toughest issues that communities can, not from the luxury of -- of a debate or a television panel or a committee room but on the ground, issues from poverty to justice in policing.",
          "The biggest crime increase in history, the biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas.",
          "Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.",

          "The future of things that matter to you -- in terms of civil rights, what kind of Justice Department you'll have, whether we'll enforce the law.",

          "We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.",
          "When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, it's the largest increase in federal spending in years.",
          "Spending was only up something like 4 percent.",
          "And so budgets reflect choices.",
          "That's exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern.",
          "The president hasn't balanced a budget yet.",
          "And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that.",
          "We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.",
          "We feel that uh - with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978.",
          "It is breaking family budgets.",
          "And sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned.",
          "Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.",
          "Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget -- no, that was no longer possible.",
          "One is make sure Congress doesn't overspend.",
          "So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.",
          "I will balance the budget every year.",
          "And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.",
          "And the reason, one of the major reasons why we're in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control.",
          "In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.",
          "And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs.",
          "I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts.",

          "If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.",
          "One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.",

          "Let me, Jason, come back to you a minute because there is a big difference in the defense budget.",
          "Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.",
          "How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.",
          "It had to do with the discussion we had had the previous day on the overall question of reducing the budget.",
          "But again, I want to come back to, notice every time Senator Obama says, \"We need to spend more, we need to spend more, that's the answer\" -- why do we always have to spend more?",
          "I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will...",
          "So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget.",
          "Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget.",
          "What things would I cut from spending?",
          "The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession - and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars - or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh - during part of the Korean War.",
          "But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted.",
          "Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.",
          "We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent.",
          "I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension.",
          "That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That's one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.",
          "We have to obviously cut spending.",
          "I want to do those two things and get this -- get this to a balanced budget with eight -- eight to 10 years.",
          "This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.",
          "We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.",
          "Senator Obama talks about the budgets I voted for.",
          "And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career.",
          "Well, look at the budget.",
          "I voted for the balanced budget in '93 and '97.",
          "And when the President was asked the other day, \"What do you want to cut in the budget?",
          "It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.",
          "I will balance the budget every year.",
          "fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.",
          "We do it by getting -- by reducing spending in a whole series of programs.",
          "You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated.",
          "And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.",
          "So, in terms of priorities, we've got to be financially strong.",
          "Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.",
          "Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget.",
          "And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.",
          "I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has.",
          "I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.",
          "And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending.",
          "We balanced the budget in the '90s.",
          "It is that we are continuing to spend too much.",
          "I think the government's spending too much.",
          "I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need.",
          "And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.",
          "This is a big spender.",
          "In San Diego where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project for the University of California San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges, a little project in a program that Senator Dole opposed.",
          "I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.",
          "If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.",
          "I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.",

          "He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal.",
          "There's no doubt itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna affect our budgets.",
          "Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.",
          "We have to start to spend the money now.",
          "When we do that, instead of shutting the government down over a partisan fight over the budget, we're a better country and that's why we're making progress now.",
          "Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending.",
          "And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.",
          "Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.",
          "The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.",
          "For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.",
          "I agree, we shouldn't have quotas.",
          "I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.",
          "We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that's good and that's helped.",
          "I will get us on track to a balanced budget.",
          "What I've done is set priorities and funded them.",
          "I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed.",
          "I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.",
          "I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.",
          "That's why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same.",
          "I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.",
          "But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.",
          "Getting us to a balanced budget.",
          "There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.",
          "The program that the president -- two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch.",
          "Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.",
          "My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?",
          "Because they have to balance their budgets.",
          "The president can modify the uh - economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes.",
          "We're doing our duty to provide the funding.",
          "Give us a balanced budget amendment.",
          "And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.",
          "Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs.",
          "That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.",
          "I propose a detailed budget, Bob.",
          "They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.",
          "And I have budgeted for that.",
          "We cut the cost - the increased cost of government - in half over the eight years.",
          "They told you at the tax and budget summit that if you agreed to a tax increase, we could balance the budget.",
          "The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country - $65 billion - primarily because our people are not at work.",
          "If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldn't look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America.",

          "We've had the Central Accounting.",

          "And this issue is, of course, very important.",
          "But it does seem to me that you've raised a very important point that needs to be addressed.",
          "Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.",
          "I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what we're talking about.",
          "And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.",
          "And it's not an easy problem to solve.",
          "And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.",
          "This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.",
          "And you know what, the issue is changing.",
          "The challenges that we face are unprecedented.",
          "And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.",
          "And no one has approached it from that matter.",
          "And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we're going to have to do something about home values.",
          "And we need to fix a lot of the problems.",
          "But this issue of certainty.",
          "This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it.",
          "And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.",
          "Yes, it's a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but itÃâ‚¬s not an insolvable problem.",
          "Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.",
          "It's critical to our future.",
          "I mean, I think in general, let's talk about these issues.",
          "It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.",
          "It's an issue that good people obviously disagree on.",
          "That's the problem with it.",
          "This is a matter of life and death.",
          "It's going to be a little tougher because we're talking about very complex and difficult issues.",
          "But we also have to take demand seriously.",
          "We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are.",
          "But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children.",
          "And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.",
          "Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.",
          "I've worked on this issue.",
          "Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.",
          "There were other issues associated with this -- with this tragedy.",
          "So, this is a very difficult situation.",
          "Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play.",
          "First of all, let me say that I've spent more of my time and life on this in the last 12 years than any other issue.",
          "And in some cases may be still at large.",
          "The means are at issue.",
          "WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll deal with our problems, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll solve our problems.",
          "And you can't just go up and say I'm going to fix it.",
          "But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.",
          "Somebody hit me and said Barry Goldwater said you ought to talk on issues more.",
          "The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.",
          "We're on a different system.",
          "Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.",
          "It has to be helped, has to be fixed.",
          "And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?",
          "This is an issue that -- look, it divides us.",
          "On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration.",
          "They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them.",
          "They're not going to be solved overnight.",
          "I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was.",
          "This keeps up with technology.",
          "They admit it's an issue.",
          "We're living in an interconnected world.",
          "And so -- on the logging issue.",
          "There's a -- no, look, there's a systemic problem.",
          "Well, I don't know of any perfect solution.",
          "Today you've got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europe's gone democracy's route.",
          "There are three fundamental challenges.",
          "This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of --",
          "And it's time for them to get serious on it.",
          "It's sort of ad hoc, just whatever comes up, we'll deal with it.",
          "But they're matters that are ah - important.",
          "Before I decided to run, I had to resolve two issues in my mind.",
          "And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.",
          "A lot of people, including me, said, look, it's not doing what it should do.",
          "This is obviously a very tender topic.",
          "Well, it's the civil rights issue of the 21st century.",
          "we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.",
          "Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer.",
          "But they know what's going on.",
          "We cannot solve this problem all on our own.",
          "If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.",
          "I think we've had a very healthy discussion.",
          "I think we ought to focus on the problems and not attack each other.",
          "That's the problem with our system.",
          "What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.",
          "Uhh - and I think uh - we've tightened it up; we've uh - straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years.",
          "For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.",
          "The means are at question.",
          "Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world.",
          "This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with.",
          "H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.",
          "I see it as a serious problem.",
          "You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.",
          "But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue.",
          "I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.",
          "More people will be hurt by continuing.",
          "Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.",
          "Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.",
          "Everybody knows how to fix them.",
          "We can't deal with them.",
          "I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue.",
          "It's a subject I'm very familiar with.",
          "Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.",
          "The issue is what you do about it.",
          "And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.",
          "But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.",
          "It's an issue of principle, not politics.",
          "Now, the facts are we have to fix it.",
          "And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.",
          "But we also have to take demand seriously.",
          "So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that's why we had to take action.",
          "And that's why people are so concerned.",
          "These kinds of things have hurt us very much.",
          "And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.",
          "And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path.",
          "In my view, the policy has failed.",
          "Well, they are the same in this issue.",
          "And we're not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours.",
          "But if they do -- if they do, it's easy to fix.",
          "This is a very important issue we're talking about.",
          "These problems are not easy.",
          "There's too many issues left unresolved.",
          "We have enough problems in this country.",
          "We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that's not how it's going to work.",
          "There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.",
          "Now, the problem is that they didn't think these things through properly.",
          "I think that is something we have to take seriously.",
          "They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad.",
          "And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.",
          "Now, that is the issue.",
          "... sent in and swamping the system...",
          "Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.",
          "I think the matter is settled once and for all.",
          "We've got fundamental problems in the system.",
          "And I said, let's fix this system.",
          "We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground.",
          "And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.",
          "And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.",
          "It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.",
          "It can't do it all, but it can make a difference.",
          "[Laughter] And yet, that's the most important single issue of our time.",
          "Well, I don't have any quarrel with that.",
          "What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren't loopholes.",
          "I think it is a deterrent.",
          "But it's getting worse by the day.",
          "I found a couple of other things we agree upon.",
          "There's not a more important issue.",
          "Well, let me say that I think that we might ought to review the terms, the way it works.",
          "But let's get back to the core issue here.",
          "Well, I think they're serious.",
          "But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.",
          "This is a big issue.",
          "Because there is a major problem there.",
          "Do we need to fix it, particularly for OGBYNs (sic) and for brain surgeons and others?",
          "I think it's very difficult.",
          "So I would think we can expedite the problem there.",
          "So, if we're at a point in history where we want to stop talking about it and do it, I've got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems, making the solutions work, and then moving on to the next one.",
          "But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve.",
          "This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.",
          "Again, see, I didn't create this problem.",
          "You can't solve a problem unless you diagnose it.",
          "We've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time.",
          "So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.",
          "It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.",
          "I think it's a party issue.",
          "What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important.",
          "We just have a bad system.",
          "We've created a mess, don't have much to show for it and we have got to fix it.",
          "So I talk about the corrupt media.",
          "Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am.",
          "I think we ought to attack our country's problems, not attack each other.",
          "Yes, we got problems at home.",
          "They've got a lot of concerns.",
          "If people don't have the stomach to fix these problems, I think it's a good time to face it, November.",
          "At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.",
          "Do you want to fix the problem or sound-bite it?",
          "It's been a big failure.",
          "And we ought to try to meet the problem.",
          "Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.",
          "We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that we're confronted with.",
          "But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.",
          "And I think it's important to understand what happened here.",
          "I think you put your finger on a major problem.",
          "But more importantly, we've reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early, before they're too late.",
          "So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.",
          "This is a very important topic and it's a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue.",
          "And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it.",
          "They would know all about our problems.",
          "I've got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem.",
          "Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.",
          "But this is an important issue.",
          "It's an issue I know a lot about.",
          "Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.",
          "We need to think differently about the issue.",
          "The fact of the matter is...",
          "That's the way the system works.",
          "This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.",
          "It's kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue.",
          "So there's some bad things going on.",
          "I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way.",
          "I don't know how to deal with it exactly.",
          "It's a very unstable situation.",
          "And it's going to take all the nations together, just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago.",
          "All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.",
          "It can't get any worse.",
          "This is an issue that will require a new attitude.",
          "I believe we ought to make the system work better.",
          "I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.",
          "And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.",
          "We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.",
          "But in any event, I understand the problems.",
          "Obviously some people are going to need help.",
          "Bret and Martha, I just thought it's interesting, you asked your question about the problems we're having in big cities.",
          "You haven't heard me mention this before, but we're getting close now and I think it's about time I start putting things in perspective.",
          "The whole problem came up in 1984.",
          "And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable.",
          "In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.",
          "So we need to preserve the system.",
          "This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community.",
          "And then you've got to fix it and do something with it.",
          "So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way.",
          "As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further.",
          "... on some of the issues that people care about tonight.",
          "I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue.",
          "We're trying to solve it.",
          "Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?",
          "That's the best way to get people back in the system.",
          "But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues.",
          "We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions.",
          "There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem.",
          "And I think first you should -- I should understand that the question on your mind is do I understand your problem.",
          "Now, again, if I get up there, if you send me, we're going to have some blunt talks about this, and we're really going to get down in the trenches and say, is this one you want to talk about or fix, because talk won't do it, folks.",
          "There is a lot of blame to go around.",
          "Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it?",
          "We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up.",
          "I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about.",
          "You can't take different positions on these difficult issues.",
          "We can deal with systemic racism.",
          "And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.",
          "This is a major problem facing America.",
          "I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously.",
          "And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue.",
          "I think the matter is settled once and for all.",
          "So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.",
          "Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.",
          "Gene, there is a problem in the sense that there are some problem banks, and on December 19th new regulations will go into effect which will in effect give the government the responsibility to close some banks that are not technically insolvent but that are plainly in trouble.",
          "I disapprove of the issue.",
          "And it's hard to build a consensus.",
          "And I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has alluded everybody else because we know how to do it.",
          "But I think it's really an important issue.",
          "And I think now we've got a problem.",
          "As we have seen tonight, foreign policy and defense policy are difficult and complex issues.",
          "And I have not made it an issue, nor should it be.",
          "And before you solve it, you have to say the name.",
          "It is a serious problem, but I don't see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was.",
          "As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues.",
          "The problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets.",
          "And so I think this is an issue.",
          "And it's a big problem.",
          "We - quite often we have a transient problem.",
          "But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success.",
          "The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged.",
          "And it has got to be brought under control.",
          "But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.",
          "We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.",
          "We've doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it.",
          "You have to gut it out, issue by issue by issue.",
          "They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations.",
          "I'd like to just talk about issues, and so --",
          "But I know putting artificial deadlines won't work.",
          "But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.",
          "It's not only what's your philosophy and what's your position on issues, but can you get things done?",
          "These are not just women's issues.",
          "All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.",
          "Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.",
          "And so I'll just be asking for support to get that put into effect.",
          "Yes, there are big problems, and yes, people are hurting.",
          "That is the central issue of our time.",
          "This is an issue they've brought up.",
          "But Columbine spoke to a larger issue.",
          "We do have a serious problem in our culture.",
          "They're aimed at the real problem.",
          "We've got to change the system.",
          "It's an issue throughout our society.",
          "And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem.",
          "But maybe there ought to be more debates.",
          "But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.",
          "But the point is that I know how to handle these crises.",
          "We must not be divided on this issue.",
          "It'll be a vital issue in my second term.",
          "We cannot afford an intelligence gap.",
          "But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.",
          "And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.",

          "I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue.",
          "I don't think it's a question of eliminating.",
          "I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.",
          "The question is the means.",

          "So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.",
          "It is -- it is a huge problem.",
          "My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them.",

          "So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.",
          "It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then.",
          "But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.",
          "This is a difficult and sensitive matter."

          "But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.",
          "We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.",
          "First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks.",

          "I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.",
          "They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country.",
          "Or do we want to go forward, marching together, as a nation of strength and that's going to continue to be strong?",

          "We got rid of that; we've kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn't indicate that we're trigger-happy.",
          "We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action.",
          "They didn't view their service as a back-door draft.",
          "So it's not just the addition of troops that matters.",

          "I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong.",
          "It works particularly when we pay our troops well.",
          "We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.",
          "We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.",
          "The mission must be clear.",

          "We'll continue to build strong coalitions.",
          "My opponent says we didn't have any allies in this war.",
          "We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.",
          "I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today.",
          "So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.",
          "We don't want to get drawn into a military conflict.",
          "It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.",
          "But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.",
          "I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests.",
          "Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.",
          "With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didn't use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world's number one criminal and terrorist.",
          "I know I can do a better job in Iraq.",
          "But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies.",
          "Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.",
          "We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand.",
          "Not what a commander in chief does when you're trying to lead troops.",
          "We're going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B-22 airplane.",
          "That's what I learned in Vietnam.",
          "And I've been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.",
          "We'll have 125,000 trained by the end of December.",
          "What message does that send to our allies?",
          "We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none.",
          "Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed.",
          "We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.",
          "We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.",
          "Some of our troops are not well-equipped.",
          "And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security.",
          "That's why they're fighting so vociferously.",
          "Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.",
          "There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.",
          "I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace.",
          "Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.",
          "We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.",
          "But we didn't use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him.",
          "I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy.",
          "We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last three and a half years under the foreign policies of this Administration of Mr. Carter's, until we're faced each time with a crisis.",
          "Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.",
          "But you can't tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8,300, and below that the four others are below 4,000, and below that, there isn't anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done.",
          "Ask the people in the armed forces today.",
          "Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war.",
          "I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy, I think it worked, and I'm pleased I took -- made the decision I made.",
          "The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.",
          "And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college.",
          "Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.",
          "Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way -- all the way through.",
          "I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.",
          "...here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.",
          "What message does that send our troops?",
          "This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.",
          "How could you be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and have some kid say -- when you have to make a tough decision, as I did in Panama or Kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say, \"Well, I'm not going to go.",
          "I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.",
          "I believe that since I've been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world.",
          "And we will never take military options off the table.",
          "we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.",
          "Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.",
          "Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.",
          "In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with.",
          "But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.",
          "But let's not cut into the muscle, and let's not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made.",
          "But I am not going to shortchange our troops in harm's way.",
          "Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty.",
          "And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage.",
          "I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.",
          "When you're attacked for your military record, I immediately said it was inappropriate, it had no place in this campaign, and I rejected it.",
          "The all- volunteer army works.",
          "We need to depend on all of our tools -- diplomatic, economic, working with our allies -- and not let the defense industry call the shots.",
          "But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.",
          "We have to also stand by our allies.",
          "Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.",
          "So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.",
          "Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.",
          "But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, \"Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''",
          "And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.",
          "And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.",
          "Soldiers must understand why we're going.",
          "I don't think we need 150,000 troops.",
          "Now we have a runaway arms race.",
          "Veterans who've sacrificed for this country.",
          "We will go with our allies.\"",
          "We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there.",
          "Two-thirds of the country was a no-fly zone when we started this war.",
          "We've changed for the first time since FDR -- since FDR we had the -- we've always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once.",
          "We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.",
          "I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.",
          "Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.",
          "So what's the message going to be: \"Please join us in Iraq.",
          "We're now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.",
          "This is a formidable force.",
          "I believe we should be stronger than we now are.",
          "And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well.",
          "We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we're asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment.",
          "A recent poll was taken among 1,000 enlisted personnel, as well as officers, over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up.",
          "When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army.",
          "But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we've got to think about capabilities.",
          "I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.",
          "That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.",
          "We're going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported.",
          "Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next four years.",
          "The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.",
          "Our allies feel that we've neglected them.",
          "It's more difficult to defend this nation.",
          "First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up.",
          "The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.",
          "We have -- our military, the morale is high.",
          "It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.",
          "I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.",
          "And a lot of our military are underpaid.",
          "Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology.",
          "The president says that I'm denigrating these troops.",
          "And we are winning in Iraq.",
          "The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy.",
          "And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.",
          "I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.",
          "Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength.",
          "They don't want this arms race.",
          "Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces.",
          "It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.",
          "I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.",
          "Recognize that we have a voluntary military.",
          "That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.",
          "We're continuing to increase manpower and equipment.",
          "And with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere, including special forces, we -- there's no way you negotiate or have been able to negotiate with terrorists.",
          "Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that?",
          "Because they understand that our military is overextended under the president.",
          "... no troops through whatsoever.",
          "As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm.",
          "Are we better of with this arms race?",
          "I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.",
          "First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, \"Don't put those troops there.''",
          "He made a statement about the military.",
          "I don't want to try to put our troops in all places at all times.",
          "I will not cut our commitment to our military.",
          "Now, forget all this talk about a draft.",
          "We had a war when we came into power in 1953.",
          "Now, if won't be, General Waller would be -- you say, why do you keep picking military people.",
          "Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission.",
          "In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops.",
          "And we don't have enough troops there.",
          "I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders.",
          "And abroad, we're at war.",
          "First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.",
          "I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.",
          "The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.",
          "Fifty times we deployed troops around the world.",
          "But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved.",
          "But it was also military.",
          "And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.",
          "I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.",
          "And I simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded.",
          "I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.",
          "And now we're fighting them now.",
          "Let me take just one question that he raises - the military strength and capability of the United States.",
          "They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.",
          "We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.",
          "I served it uh - in the war.",
          "And today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs.",
          "They look at our -- our decision to -- to cut back on our military capabilities.",
          "I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.",
          "We're blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence.",
          "I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, \"Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?\"",
          "We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.",
          "I would very much like to get our troops out of there.",
          "I'm sorry, you actually -- there was a -- there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on.",
          "but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom.",
          "A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.",
          "And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.",
          "For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind.",
          "We need to rebuild our alliances.",
          "And, so, that's the way I'd reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report.",
          "Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn't even understand that.",
          "We have a duty to defeat this enemy.",
          "And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam.",
          "I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.",
          "I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.",
          "We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure.",
          "And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.",
          "Well, we still are the envy of the world in terms of our military.",
          "And we honor all the service that they've provided.",
          "See, for 45 years we were preoccupied with the Red Army.",
          "There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.",
          "But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.",
          "We need to deny them the recruits.",
          "We want to be stronger.",
          "I saw a high school that is military.",
          "But it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people--and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions.",
          "It's to make sure our troops are well-housed and well-equipped.",
          "We've got to attack at all points, we've go to use undercover operations.",
          "And I think it's the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today.",
          "I served my country in Vietnam.",
          "And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.",
          "But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.",
          "We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.",
          "My message to the troops is also: Thank you for what they're doing, but it's also help is on the way.",
          "Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years.",
          "I would have brought our allies to our side.",
          "That's the nature of the enemy, by the way.",
          "I know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.",
          "Now, what I've said is we should end this war responsibly.",
          "I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.",
          "I think that defense needs to be -- with fewer people in permanent armed services but with greater mobility on the land, in the air and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high technology weaponry and well trained people.",
          "We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.",
          "We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now.",
          "And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded.",
          "The military will be an all-volunteer army.",
          "Did we have any allies helping?",
          "But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.",
          "We will not make war inevitable.",
          "And that means keeping our military strong.",
          "When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test.",
          "Well, we're going to be finished by 2014, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.",
          "I'm going to get the training done for our troops.",
          "We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.",
          "One of the things we've done is we've taken the -- we're beginning to transform our military.",
          "Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.",
          "They said even if we are the strongest if we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do something if we don't have a clear vision of the military, if we don't stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and I'm going to prevent that.",
          "As an aid to enlistment.",
          "The military's job is to win the war.",
          "An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world.",
          "We have an arms race underway instead.",
          "But we have to use our military wisely.",
          "And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.",
          "And I'd like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we've probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department.",
          "Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we notify them of any uh - military maneuvers that are to be be undertaken.",
          "Yes, I think we need more troops.",
          "My opponent says help is on the way, but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm's way, \"wrong war, wrong place, wrong time\"?",
          "There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reductions in our military uh - appropriation.",
          "We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.",
          "We will reform our military.",
          "Now, I honor your service in World War II, I honor Mr. Perot's service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever served, including Admiral Crowe, who was your Chairman of the joint Chiefs and who's supporting me.",
          "But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.",
          "And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.",
          "I think if we learned anything in Vietnam is you first commit this nation before you commit the troops to the battlefield.",
          "This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.",
          "We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.",
          "And from that point on, I've voted to -- I moved to bring those troops home.",
          "The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased.",
          "We can't simply be focused on Iraq.",
          "I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.",
          "I don't want to send troops any place.",
          "And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.",
          "Was this really going to war as a last resort?",
          "I worry about morale in today's military.",
          "You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn't sit around.",
          "Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars.",
          "It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone, to discount their sacrifices.",
          "Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesn't believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake.",
          "And we will come home with victory and with honor.",
          "And I'm a big fan of NATO.",
          "But why start an arms race now?",
          "But not until they have given us the full accounting of our MIAs.",
          "But when you go to put somebody else's son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there's a military plan that can do this.",
          "Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that.",
          "They're in the civilian labor market and they're not fighting anywhere around the world today.",
          "In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there.",
          "Our troops have performed brilliantly.",
          "We'll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year.",
          "You can't expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq.",
          "If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States.",
          "And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there.",
          "They're trying to defeat us.",
          "We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be.",
          "We need to have strong allies.",
          "Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.",
          "We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day.",
          "Of course, I listen to our generals.",
          "But a president must always be willing to use troops.",
          "We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America.",
          "I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.",
          "Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.",
          "And we said, \"Why not cut out the middleman?\"",
          "So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe.",
          "I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.",
          "And when it gets overextended, morale drops.",
          "You thought it should have been 5,000 troops...",
          "Under my leadership we're going to win this war in Iraq.",
          "Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed.",
          "Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated.",
          "And if I were to ever say, \"This is the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place,\" the troops would wonder, how can I follow this guy?",
          "Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq?",
          "Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.",
          "We don't need mass armies anymore.",
          "I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.",
          "Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home.",
          "How strong are we going to be?",
          "Coming out of World War II it made sense.",
          "I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm's way.",
          "Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq.",
          "There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.",
          "I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign, and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question, that I would never uh - go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened.",
          "Not a single young American today is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield.",
          "I'm going to get the training of Iraqis done faster.",
          "I. too, believe in the voluntary military.",
          "I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing.",
          "Which means, of course, that uh - we will have to maintain an adequate military capability - which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh - I think uh - a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces - adequate conventional forces.",
          "And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man.",
          "And therefore, if I only had another second left, I'd say that that high school class in a military training - 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country.",
          "They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.",
          "We can't leave a failed Iraq.",
          "As I understand it, we're building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they've got a rather permanent concept to them.",
          "See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.",
          "Our military is assisting in Iraq.",
          "And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.",
          "It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy.",
          "We have a depleted military.",
          "And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it's been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.",
          "The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.",
          "I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course.",
          "Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.",
          "But the joint chiefs say we're stronger and more confident and solid than ever.",
          "I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely we'll ever have to use troops.",
          "Our Navy is old -- excuse me, our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.",
          "We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred - three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand.",
          "We've got to pay our troops more.",
          "And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided",
          "I was honored to speak to those troops.",
          "In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation?",
          "And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military.",
          "And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.",
          "You've got a back-door draft right now.",
          "They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq.",
          "I hear there's rumors on the Internets (sic) that we're going to have a draft.",
          "Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947.",
          "Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.",
          "We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed.",
          "But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.",
          "We have to work more closely with our allies.",
          "But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.",
          "And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.",
          "It will help change the world; that we can look back and say we did our duty.",
          "Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops.",
          "The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built.",
          "This was just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.",
          "But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our -- of our troops.",
          "You don't send troops to war without the body armor that they need.",
          "I do not believe in cutting our military.",
          "I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry.",
          "And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.",
          "But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.",
          "But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority.",
          "So our troops will come home at that point.",
          "And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home.",
          "And our enemies are strengthened from all of this.",
          "I want to have the military keeping the peace.",
          "I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.",
          "Again, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year.",
          "I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.",
          "Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army.",
          "And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves.",
          "This evening we talked about national strength.",
          "General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.",
          "Our military is the strongest military in the world.",
          "We need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenges of a post cold war era, a smaller permanent military force, but one that is more mobile, well trained with high technology equipment.",
          "In Iraq, no doubt about it, it's tough.",
          "If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.",
          "I know we're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens.",
          "Now, I'm going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and I'm going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because I'm going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did, President Eisenhower did, and others.",
          "The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing.",
          "I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete.",
          "That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there.",
          "And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace.",
          "I disagree that we need 150,000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe.",
          "Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.",
          "When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee.",
          "And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions.",
          "That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.",
          "And I would hope to never have to use force.",
          "Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be?",
          "They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.",
          "We gave them ample time.",
          "I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the revolution.",
          "But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice.",
          "And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.",
          "The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.",
          "And I hope you'll give me an opportunity to serve again.",
          "And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long-term.",
          "I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq.",
          "Never wanted to commit troops.",
          "It's kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $30-billion tab to defend your country.",
          "When the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem, our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat.",
          "And we pushed our allies aside.",
          "And I think that the same people that took us into Iraq War, the same people who took us into the Vietnam War, you cannot end -- you not start another no-win war.",
          "But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now.",
          "We need to have as well a strong military.",
          "But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.",
          "We're using the military more now in terms of interdiction.",
          "I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.",
          "We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.",
          "Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.",
          "I know what thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like when an army is defeated.",
          "And now there's 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops.",
          "And I will succeed for those troops, now that we're there.",
          "That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.",
          "And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.",
          "A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn't through any fault of their own, but they were defeated.",
          "Join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time?\"",
          "We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.",
          "I don't think we need them to remain strong.",
          "And we would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense related jobs.",
          "Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement.",
          "That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; it's been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO.",
          "And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you.",
          "Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us.",
          "I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.",
          "But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.",
          "No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.",
          "I feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country.",
          "Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.",
          "Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President.",
          "Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love.",
          "If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.",
          "That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed.",
          "It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.",
          "America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.",
          "And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove -- to remove Assad.",
          "And our alliance is strong.",
          "We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.",
          "And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, \"Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''",
          "I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?",
          "I've spent my whole adult life very close to the military.",
          "Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.",
          "And we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it, and you just saw it in response to previous questions.",
          "My message to our troops is, \"Thank you for what you're doing.",
          "...of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.",
          "You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.",
          "I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war.",
          "I am not going to commit US forces until I know what the mission is, till the military tell me that it can be completed, and till I know how they can come out.",
          "This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it.",
          "That's why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe.",
          "To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, \"If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother applying for any construction.\"",
          "Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country.",
          "But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.",
          "Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win.",
          "And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.",
          "Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.",
          "We busted the 4th largest army, and we did it through leadership.",
          "It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops.",
          "The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible.",
          "I think the reason that we're not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold.",
          "And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.",
          "And this strategy, and this general, they are winning.",
          "We would have to close twenty military bases in the United States immediately.",
          "And so we're moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment.",
          "And so, we've got a good military.",
          "To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area.",
          "Defense industries are going to have to convert to civilian industries.",
          "We've got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, who've been involved, in their initiative.",
          "But I have spent my whole life serving this country.",
          "So, yes, I told the American Legion National!",
          "We'll be resolute, we'll be strong, and we'll wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists.",
          "I don't see how you can lead troops if you say it's the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.",
          "I understand how hard it is to commit troops.",
          "Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily.",
          "We'll continue to build our alliances.",
          "It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they're housed better and have a focused mission for our military.",

          "Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.",
          "We're going to use force and we're going to leave them stone-cold dead.",
          "Morale in today's military is too low.",
          "Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.",
          "One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.",
          "We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily.",
          "Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.",
          "And we'll get you home as soon as the mission's done, because this is a vital mission.\"",
          "First thing I'm going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure we're not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world.",
          "During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.",
          "And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that.",
          "In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region.",
          "I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.",
          "I have, obviously, supported those efforts that the United States had to go in militarily and I have opposed that I didn't think so.",
          "It encourages them to begin a war.",
          "But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it.",
          "And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?",
          "And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.",
          "We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way.",
          "And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies.",
          "But we ought to stand staunch.",
          "And we are not well served when we attack each other in a kind of ad hominem way.",
          "It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.",
          "And I want to fight for them.",
          "And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.",

          "My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with.",
          "My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.",
          "We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here.",
          "Now, that's not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer.",
          "The force must be strong enough so that the mission can be accomplished.",
          "We still have lots of troops in Europe.",
          "I understand what the president is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat.",

          "I volunteered for the Army.",
          "We have not maintained our position and our prestige.",
          "That would not start a war.",
          "And I'm going to get our allies back to the table.",

          "He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups.",
          "We only have ten divisions now.",
          "We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military.",
          "One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.",
          "You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.",
          "One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for?",
          "We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.",
          "If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you're going to put a lot more out of work.",
          "So military security and economic security go hand in hand.",
          "I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.",
          "And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power.",
          "No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.",
          "I will not cut our military budget.",
          "Our military is second to none in the world.",
          "Several months ago the Vietnam government said, \"We are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on MIAs.",
          "It is our greatest ally in the region.",

          "In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.",
          "You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.",
          "We're not going to have a draft, period.",
          "And I believe our troops need other allies helping.",
          "You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, \"Don't bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren't part of our original coalition.\"",

          "If we're going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and we've had more deployments under this administration than any time in history.",
          "So we can fight this war, and we can win this war.",
          "And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war.",
          "I agree our military is the strongest in the world today, that's not the question.",
          "That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.",
          "Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.",
          "And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq.",
          "I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections.",
          "I've been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we've faced in the last 20-some years.",
          "I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, \"Do you have what you need in this war?",
          "Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition that's coming in this strong economy from the private sector.",
          "That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.",
          "My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement.",
          "I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war.",
          "I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.",
          "I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam.",
          "And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.",
          "So to answer your question is, we're withdrawing, not from the world, we're withdrawing manpower so they can be stationed here in America, so there's less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to be -- we'll be more likely to be able to keep people in the all-volunteer army.",
          "I didn't say I would bring troops out in six months.",
          "This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.",
          "And the result is our forces today are overextended.",
          "Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight.",
          "You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.",
          "I will never let those troops down, and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are.",
          "It's not just more troops.",
          "No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that.",
          "In addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve.",
          "We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.",
          "It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.",

          "And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn't understand, it's got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq.",
          "And our alliance is strong.",
          "But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.",
          "And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.",
          "I believe we should have a stronger military force.",

          "You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?",
          "For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.",
          "When you leave office, you don't leave any judges.",
          "I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.",
          "I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment.",
          "And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.",
          "So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.",
          "I've tried to use the White House as a bully pulpit, speaking out against discrimination.",
          "But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate.",
          "And - and that's a reversal of position uh by the Burger Court with which I do agree.",
          "We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.",
          "Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?",
          "And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right.",
          "I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.",
          "The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life.",
          "I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor.",
          "I would pick somebody who would strictly interpret the Constitution of the United States.",
          "And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.",
          "That they're appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred.",
          "What I want to find, if I am privileged to have the opportunity to do it -- and the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race, ladies and gentlemen.",
          "I uh - believe, however, a comment ought to be made about the direction of the uh - Burger Court, vis-a-vis the uh - court uh - that preceded it.",
          "Legislators make law; judges interpret the Constitution.",
          "I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.",
          "They would have won an appeal.",
          "Opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America.",
          "However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion.",
          "After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.",
          "I don't favor equal results, but I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're competent.",
          "That's not what the Constitution says.",
          "And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.",
          "Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form but I don't favor creating special rights for any group.",
          "So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.",
          "And I think that in that case uh - some of the more liberal uh - members of the uh - so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions.",
          "I don't think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights.",
          "I said I'm opposed to discrimination.",
          "I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens.",
          "I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, \"Reading is the new civil right,\" and she's right.",
          "And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment.",
          "A few years ago when he came to office, the president said -- these are his words -- \"What we need are some good conservative judges on the courts.\"",
          "When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.",
          "Those are the kind of judges I will appoint.",
          "We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment.",
          "Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.",
          "And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.",
          "A governor gets to name supreme court judges.",
          "And as I just said that I believe that the passage of the so-called Title Three, which gives the Attorney General the power to protect Constitutional rights in those cases where it's not possible for the person involved to bring the suit.",
          "I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.",
          "I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.",
          "I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will.",
          "I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench.",
          "And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.",
          "Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won't take a position on that.",
          "And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.",
          "I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California - and we were the first to do it.",

          "They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.",

          "It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.",

          "If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.",
          "That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.",

          "More people are understanding the importance of that, including conservative legal scholars, who says he may be disqualified under the 14th Amendment from being President, again, as a result of the insurrection.",
          "On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago.",
          "I think that's an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision-making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution.",
          "But because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they're qualified, I favor the right kind of Affirmative Action.",
          "But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them.",
          "The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.",
          "It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.",
          "People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy.",
          "I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.",
          "I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas.",
          "I do think it's fair to note -- he can rebut it -- but Arkansas is one of the few states that doesn't have any civil rights legislation.",
          "I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.",
          "The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges.",
          "And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade.",
          "You just know you're reading a good judicial decision.",
          "I mean, I -- because I think whoever is the president must guard your liberties, must not erode your rights in America.",
          "They will be protecting the Second Amendment.",
          "What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges?",
          "Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.",
          "Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.",
          "And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments.",
          "And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.",
          "He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.",
          "You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices.",
          "And he said also that his two favorite justices are Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas.",
          "Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.",
          "It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific.",
          "I'll tell you what kind of judges he'll put on.",
          "I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.",
          "I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations.",
          "Uh I call that the people amendment.",
          "We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.",
          "And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.",
          "I don't believe in liberal activist judges.",
          "Voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench.",
          "Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.",
          "And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.",
          "I proposed a constitutional amendment.",
          "And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.",
          "And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.",
          "That's not the way we should judge these nominees.",
          "And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.",
          "But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.",
          "So in those two cases I think uh - such uh - a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don't think in either case they're trivial matters.",
          "I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.",
          "I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.",
          "And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.",
          "So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion.",
          "And that means, for example, standing up for human rights.",
          "Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill.",
          "I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court.",
          "So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.",
          "I want to be judicious in its use.",
          "I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.",
          "And that's the kind of judge I'm going to put on there.",
          "Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?",
          "But I've not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate.",
          "Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.",
          "I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.",
          "I will always stand up for our Constitution, regardless of the political pressure.",
          "And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don't deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they can't afford it otherwise.",
          "And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, \"view,\" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government.",
          "I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble.",
          "Uh - we've always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed, but the passage of them has been uh - fairly slow, and uh - few and far between.",
          "Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.",
          "I would pick somebody who would not allow their personal opinion to get in the way of the law.",
          "Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent."

          "And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.",
          "And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.",
          "We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we've got to control the health care costs for those people -- otherwise we can't keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets.",
          "We have to be able to compete in the world market.",
          "And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.",
          "Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.",
          "The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.",
          "But we have horrible deals.",
          "Another thing that I'd like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world.",
          "Nothing will ever top NAFTA.",
          "Now, on the subject of free trade agreements.",

          "In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.",
          "Now, if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, it's that agreement that's about to be put into practice.",
          "You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.",
          "They want to get into our market.",
          "Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.",
          "Look, if Ross were right when we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldn't they have gone down there now?",
          "But let's not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that'll simply price us out of the international market.",

          "I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.",
          "It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan.",
          "And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.",
          "They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.",
          "I'm for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don't have good trade agreements across the world.",
          "We have to renegotiate our trade deals.",
          "But I think that the important point is we've got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.",
          "I believe in free trade.",
          "I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama.",
          "I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.",
          "Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.",
          "Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?",
          "So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.",
          "And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the prime minister of Canada, I might add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas.",
          "We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.",
          "So we're going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules.",
          "The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.",
          "We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.",
          "That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?",
          "Both said that this administration turned down the \"walk in the woods'' agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security.",
          "That means those cars can be exported, 'cause that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it'll save money in your pocketbook.",
          "And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.",
          "There is a partnership involved in our nation.",
          "Now, if you just want to get down to brass tacks, first thing you ought to do is get all these folks who've got these 1-way trade agreements that we've negotiated over the years and say fellas, we'll take the same deal we gave you.",
          "I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.",
          "When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.",
          "He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.",
          "The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be -- need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts.",
          "But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust.",
          "Now I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations.",
          "We don't have free trade.",
          "Let's try to expand our markets abroad.",
          "So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?",
          "I have a realistic approach to trade.",
          "We are the ones that lowered the barrier to products with Carla Hill's negotiation.",
          "And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.",
          "I am for the North American Free Trade Agreement.",
          "But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.",
          "We've negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.",
          "As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China.",
          "The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field.",
          "If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.",
          "Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.",
          "Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.",
          "The NAFTA agreement is defective.",
          "We hammerlock the American companies -- American Airlines, Delta -- the last few great we have, because we're trying to do this deal with these 2 European companies.",
          "We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.",
          "Well, I think that trade is an important issue.",
          "And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true.",
          "We need to expand our exports, and they're going very, very well, indeed.",
          "I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.",
          "Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America.",
          "The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.",
          "The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...",
          "Many would trade for it.",
          "It's a very sacred contract, and I believe in it.",
          "There is a ravenous demand for them overseas.",
          "But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement.",
          "I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.",
          "I'm going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas.",
          "That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money.",
          "We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.",
          "But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues -- trying to be one thing to one person here that's opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it -- what we call waffling.",
          "Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.",
          "If they weren't willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together.",
          "I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding.",
          "So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.",
          "Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.",
          "Now, we're going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules.",
          "And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.",
          "They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters.",
          "That's why we've kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal.",
          "Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.",
          "So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.",
          "I am talking of taking the treaty back, and going back into negotiations.",
          "Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last four years.",
          "You called it the gold standard of trade deals.",
          "We've expanded trade adjustment assistance.",
          "And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president.",
          "For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field.",
          "You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.",
          "We're the most competitive country in the world now, and then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale, and that's what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do.",
          "And what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn't being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.",
          "And by working with all of the nations in the region -- unlike the policies of this administration and unlike the President said, they have not supported negotiations in that region -- we will be much stronger, because we'll have the moral authority that goes with those efforts.",
          "I will not agree to any production restrictions -- or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements.",
          "We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through.",
          "And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense.",
          "I believe that we need to export more so I'll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family.",
          "We've got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now.",
          "I supported the President's trade policy.",
          "This would take a lot of negotiation.",
          "We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.",
          "I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.",
          "And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.",
          "And I'd love to be out of workers and have to import them, like some of our international competitors.",
          "If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment.",
          "We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues.",
          "That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.",
          "Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.",
          "Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.",
          "Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue.",
          "We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy.",
          "You implement that NAFTA, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people a dollar an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and you're going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order.",
          "So I will keep on as president trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT Round, the big Uruguay Round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture particularly.",
          "We cannot be successful going against the cartel unless we bring in Mexico as a partner.",
          "It's ruining us in trade.",
          "If we don't have access to their markets the same way they've access our markets, we ought to say, \"Wait, that's enough.",
          "I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead.",
          "I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.",
          "Trade grows about 12 percent year.",
          "And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.",
          "We didn't have access to their markets.",
          "And NAFTA doesn't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.",
          "Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.",
          "Believe it or not folks, you can't ship it all overseas, you've got to make it here.",

          "What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.",
          "And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.",
          "We're going to have a lot of free trade.",
          "It also means we're helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets.",
          "I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.",
          "That's why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs.",
          "And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.",

          "Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.",
          "And I'm going to offer it to America.",
          "So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.",
          "There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.",
          "The heart and soul of our disastrous trade agreements -- and I'm the guy who voted against NAFTA and against permanent normal trade relations with China -- is that we have forced American workers to compete against people in Mexico, in China, elsewhere, who earn starvation wages, $1 or $2 an hour.",
          "But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.",
          "We have not known what we've wanted and we've been out-traded in almost every instance.",
          "I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker.",
          "We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.",
          "And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.",
          "And we did drive them to the negotiating table.",
          "Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.",
          "But, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, 'this is a really dangerous thing,' and a memo out of that meeting - not from his administration, but from some of the brokers - said, 'sell short, because we gotta get moving.",
          "We should have been much tougher on trade even then.",
          "Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.",
          "We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.",
          "What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways.",
          "When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.",
          "And we ought to expand our markets abroad.",
          "That is not free trade.",
          "Ross says, with great conviction, he opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement.",
          "It's one of these deals where, in order to be popular in the halls of Europe, you sign a treaty.",
          "So more trade but on fair terms -- and favor investment in America.",
          "The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.",
          "And if we haven't learned from the negotiating history on that, we'll never learn.",
          "You have to work on this day in and day out, every month ,every year, every issue, to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade.",
          "That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.",
          "NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.",
          "What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.",
          "We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.",
          "By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, \"Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China.\"",
          "And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.",
          "So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those.",
          "We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.",
          "Look at the INF treaty.",
          "We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.",
          "And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that.",
          "I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don't want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out.",
          "But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes.",
          "This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.",
          "Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports.",
          "Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye.",
          "We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.",
          "And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.",
          "And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return.",
          "Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world?",
          "This is the worst trade year in American history by far.",
          "I don't; I believe in free and fair trade, and that's the thing that saved us.",
          "You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.",
          "And I assume some of those are because of our trading partners.",
          "In the case of the Helsinki agreement - it may have been a good agreement at the beginning, but we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out.",
          "We're selling American automobiles in Japan now.",
          "You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.",
          "The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.",
          "There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.",
          "So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.",
          "I want more trade, and I know there are some good things in that agreement.",
          "We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it's worse this year than last year, and it's worse last year than the year before.",
          "We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.",
          "You say who's making these deals?",
          "We're going the make great deals.",
          "Free trade with Colombia is something that's a no-brainer.",
          "I'm caught in the middle on NAFTA.",
          "It's not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me.",
          "In other words, trading with other countries.",
          "Because we've had tough aggressive trade policies, and because we've got interest rates down.",
          "But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.",
          "By the president having five powers - four or five powers - and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government.",
          "And that will be as bad as NAFTA.",
          "Number two, we're going to increase our trade.",
          "They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.",
          "I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.",
          "But look at that deal.",
          "We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.",
          "Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.",
          "And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.",
          "I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world.",
          "They have to understand we want to trade with them."

          "Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.",
          "And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government.",
          "I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.",
          "We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results.",
          "We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.",
          "I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.",
          "The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place.",
          "And when I am re-elected, I believe one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress not beholden to the old ways to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesn't put a lot of inhibitions on it, and protects the depositors through keeping the FDIC sound.",
          "Fortunately, a democracy took over, but this nation was embarrassed by this current administration's adoption of their policies.",
          "We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.",
          "I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families.",
          "But the federal government also can play a very important role.",
          "Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva.",
          "It makes no sense, and it must change, and we shouldn't be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality.",
          "And if I'm elected president that's gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change.",
          "I want to change those provisions.",
          "And how do we expect to be able to implement those?",
          "And institutions are beginning to function.",
          "I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government.",
          "And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible.",
          "I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first.",
          "It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.",
          "One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.",
          "In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.",
          "I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.",
          "And that can only be done through governmental action.",
          "Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed.",
          "I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage.",
          "Government shouldn't be a heavy hand.",
          "I don't want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers.",
          "I don't rule out modernization, and there are discussions going on now in the Congress, I know with the Pentagon, about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the triad.",
          "But I've always said trickle-down government is bad.",
          "I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.",
          "The people need to take their government back.",
          "And yet the cash register's empty and it used to have our money, the taxpayers' money, in it, and we didn't get the results.",
          "Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.",
          "The government has a role.",
          "And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means.",
          "I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have.",
          "We have a government that doesn't work.",
          "Why did our government do it?",
          "The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.",
          "Not working with government alone, but all of us working together.",
          "I'm totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we don't.",
          "We used to -- you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country.",
          "I don't want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers.",
          "It's being worked now in 1700 communities -- bypassed Congress on this one, Ross -- 1700 communities across the country.",
          "But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.",
          "A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own.",
          "It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.",
          "There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated.",
          "But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.",
          "Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government - our government - to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights?",
          "But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them and we'll have to scrub every agency of government.",
          "The fact-finding committee's powers are limited.",
          "I don't want the government financing congressional elections.",
          "Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?",
          "And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.",
          "And I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance, if people stay there too long.",
          "I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those.",
          "The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.",
          "Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration.",
          "So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.",
          "So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.",
          "The federal government is going to run it.",
          "I think the government can do better.",
          "But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.",
          "On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people -- not change for the sake of change, tax and spend.",
          "For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.",
          "We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.",
          "But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.",

          "In the first century of our nation's history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind.",
          "And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments.",
          "Number two, seeing a -- a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us.",
          "What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.",
          "I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.",

          "That's where government should not be.",
          "You've got to reform Congress, they've got to be servants of the people again; you've got to reform the White House.",
          "I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.",
          "The federal program doesn't do that.",

          "Whether or not it's -- the same in domestic policy as well.",
          "I believe in limited government.",
          "The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves.",
          "And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983.",
          "Do you know that it's gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people?",
          "Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives.",
          "I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.",
          "I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate.",
          "The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work.",
          "Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.",
          "And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.",
          "And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.",
          "That's why I'd have regulation.",
          "This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people.",
          "And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.",
          "Let's reform it and fund it.",
          "(LAUGHTER) I said I'd do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform.",
          "We changed many provisions I authored, cover preexisting conditions, portability, and there are other things we can do.",
          "Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.",
          "That's not a grand coalition.",
          "When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.",
          "The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?",
          "I don't think the Fed ought to be put under the Executive Branch.",
          "There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.",
          "So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.",
          "It basically protected states from the action of one state to another.",
          "But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.",
          "Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this nation that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer.",
          "Then the question is, can we govern?",
          "This isn't the kind of Administration we need.",
          "As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.",
          "And uh - it would be of - of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers' money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.",
          "I don't think there are any villains inside government on this issue, but there's sure a lot of people who don't understand business.",
          "It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.",
          "I spent my life in the private sector, not in government.",
          "The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.",
          "They say, \"We feel like we're under attack from our own government.\"",
          "And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently.",
          "Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.",
          "One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure.",
          "This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government.",
          "Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.",
          "Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.",
          "It's who you trust, government or people.",
          "But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things.",
          "Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it.",
          "We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members.",
          "Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote?",
          "It's what the federal government does to you.",
          "It's not a government plan.",
          "I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.",
          "And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.",
          "We just need government as good as our people.",
          "And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.",
          "But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs.",
          "We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.",
          "Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds.",
          "for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.",
          "And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.",
          "On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.",
          "It is not a government takeover.",
          "I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.",
          "We've got a government of stalemate.",
          "But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.",
          "As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.",
          "I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.",
          "We uh - have got to do that at the federal government level.",
          "But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.",
          "There's nothing -- the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit.",
          "I don't have any experience in gridlock government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else.",
          "And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government.",
          "We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.",
          "I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.",
          "That means keep government out of it.",
          "But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.",
          "And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time.",
          "That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.",
          "The facts are you now have a government that comes at you.",
          "The programs that we've been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don't work.",
          "As you notice, he starts talking about government.",
          "But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.",
          "I don't believe the present administration has done that.",
          "And it would be a federal law preventing that.",
          "I have been a strong force for reform.",
          "I don't want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you can't do this any more.",
          "We provide for managed competition, not government models, in every states.",
          "We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government.",
          "And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts.",
          "It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.",
          "The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.",
          "I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level.",
          "This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people.",
          "I want to change many of its provisions.",
          "There are companies that wanted to petition the administration.",
          "Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.",
          "And I pledge to reduce it by 10 percent our federal nondefense workforce.",
          "Well, one of the very serious things that's happened in our government in recent years, and has continued up until now, is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty-seven-minute delay]",
          "I have met with the heads of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally.",
          "That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.",
          "I'm going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system.",
          "And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years.",
          "I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones.",
          "The President just said that his government is shrinking."

          "I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions.",
          "The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.",
          "Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost.",
          "We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries saying people can't be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when they've just had babies.",
          "It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color.",
          "In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.",
          "And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.",
          "If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.",
          "Well, it's pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion?",
          "(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.",
          "Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion.",
          "You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.",
          "I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.",
          "I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.",
          "And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.",
          "Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.",
          "The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with.",
          "And it used the term \"death of the unborn child.''",
          "When they said, \"We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding.\"",
          "He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.",
          "For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment.",
          "I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.",
          "So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.",
          "But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.",
          "With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all.",
          "They're from a fertility clinic.",
          "So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.",
          "And I think a woman's right to choose ought to be protected and defended.",
          "Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.",
          "And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.",
          "Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?",
          "What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.",
          "I support a woman's right to choose.",
          "My answer is, we're not going to spend taxpayers' money on abortion.",
          "I signed the partial-birth -- the ban on partial-birth abortion.",
          "All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.",
          "But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.",
          "I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.",
          "I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted.",
          "We've been battling over abortion for a long period of time.",
          "And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.",
          "I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.",
          "It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.",
          "I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications.",
          "First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible.",
          "And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it.",
          "And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.",
          "But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided.",
          "Because you left out one other exception, the health of the mother.",
          "With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.",
          "That's a decision that only a woman can make, after consulting her conscience and consulting her religious principles.",
          "And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother.",
          "I know we need to ban partial birth abortions.",
          "I support the death penalty.",
          "As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.",
          "I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.",
          "Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion.",
          "With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception.",
          "And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of.",
          "I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.",
          "And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.",
          "And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.",
          "I think once a decision has been made, it's been made unless it's proven to be unsafe to women.",
          "Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.",
          "I know a lady in Florida named Penny, she survived multiple abortion attempts.",
          "I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.",
          "I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.",
          "It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade.",
          "Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this?",
          "This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.",
          "But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?",
          "First contact should be with the money when she's pregnant.",
          "And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.",
          "He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live.",
          "Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible.",
          "The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.",
          "I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.",
          "Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America.",
          "They're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets.",
          "First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.",
          "It's one way to help reduce abortions.",
          "Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.",
          "If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that's because it's not true.",
          "But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.",
          "And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.",
          "I don't think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion.",
          "Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?",
          "So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.",
          "Will women's rights be protected?",
          "Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that.",
          "It says, for example, that a woman doesn't have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist.",
          "I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.",
          "And I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.",
          "And can't we all agree that we are not going to put a woman in jail or give her the death penalty if she gets an abortion?",
          "This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America.",
          "Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.",
          "But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?",
          "And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.",
          "Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion.",
          "I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.",
          "That's the one who is being aborted.",
          "But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...",
          "And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they're doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region.",
          "support the uh - Republican uh - platform, which calls for the constitutional amendment that would uh - outlaw abortions.",
          "That's why I think it's important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning.",
          "You'll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies.",
          "The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned.",
          "Will a woman's right to choose be protected?",
          "The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion.",
          "Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights.",
          "I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.",
          "Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have.",
          "But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, I'll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures.",
          "I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.",
          "Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion.",
          "And I would hope that we would give to women in this country the right to make that decision, and to make it in the exercise of their conscience and religious beliefs.",
          "And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.",
          "I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?",
          "I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.",
          "But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.",
          "We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.",
          "The embryo had already been destroyed prior to my decision.",
          "But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.",
          "Doctors don't dare to deliver babies sometimes because they're afraid that somebody's going to sue them.",
          "As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life.",
          "That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.",
          "There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.",
          "I do not favor abortion.",
          "And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife.",
          "And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.",
          "I believe that choice is a woman's choice.",
          "And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.",
          "That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, \"health.\"",
          "I'm against the partial-birth abortion, but you've got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother.",
          "These weren't taken from abortion or something like that.",
          "I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.",
          "Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.",
          "But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion.",
          "And the reason is crack babies being born, babies in the hospital 42 days.",
          "Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.",
          "I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.",
          "And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.",
          "So no Republican president can ban abortions, any more than a Democrat president could ban all those state laws.",
          "The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.",
          "And that was rejected, and that's why I voted present, because I'm willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.",
          "The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade.",
          "I will defend Planned Parenthood.",
          "But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, \"We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.\"",
          "And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.",
          "But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea.",
          "In other words, if you're a mom and you're pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one.",
          "Now, I think we can do ethically guided embryonic stem-cell research.",
          "I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.",
          "And it is the most important issue for women and for the unborn child and for our country that we get this right.",
          "Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.",
          "You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.",
          "You talk about women and women's rights?",
          "When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.",
          "And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy."

          "I have said again and again, and this really upsets the establishment in Washington, that we're going to inform the people in detail on the issues through an electronic town hall so that they really know what's going on.",
          "I believe Washington ought to set standards, but again I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and I think we ought to work with people at the local levels.",
          "That happened long before I arrived in Washington, D.C.",
          "Sure, you can do that with Congress.",
          "Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this.",
          "It's kind of Washington, D.C. focus.",

          "We're going to have a new Congress, and we're going to say to them, you've listened to the voters the way we have.",
          "And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.",

          "The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States.",

          "If you get grassroots America excited about it, and if they tap Congress on the shoulder and say do it, Charlie, it'll happen.",
          "Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things.",
          "And it's going to take discipline of the executive branch; it's going to take discipline of the congressional branch.",
          "But I believe that this Agenda for American renewal I have is the answer to do it, and I believe we can get it done now, whereas we didn't in the past, because you're going to have a whole brand new bunch of people in the Congress that are going to have to listen to the same American people I'm listening to.",

          "And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.",
          "But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman.",

          "I think that's the essence of leadership, rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington.",
          "And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.",
          "My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is.",
          "My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.",
          "Well, I think it starts with Washington.",
          "And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington.",
          "Now, when you out-spend Congress you're really swinging.",
          "Because I went to Washington to fix problems.",
          "But most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.",
          "And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.",
          "But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.",
          "But there's going to be a new Congress.",
          "And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.",
          "They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.",
          "We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.",
          "-- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.",
          "If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.",
          "And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.",
          "I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.",
          "Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue.",

          "There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.",
          "And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.",
          "But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.",

          "Whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time.",

          "That's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.",
          "It's obvious that there are certain things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people.",

          "I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies who've never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldn't be in the administration.",
          "We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh - a great many uh - allegations of wrong-doing, of uh - alleged immorality, uh - those are very disturbing to the American people.",

          "A lot of people are sick and tired of the bitterness in Washington, D.C. and therefore they don't want any part of politics.",
          "I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.",
          "And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this.",
          "The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year.",
          "My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C.",
          "Now, John's been in the Congress for 20 years.",
          "We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.",
          "We ought to make them disclose the people they've given money to when they're testifying before congressional committees; we ought to close the lawyers' loopholes; they ought to have to disclose when they're really lobbying.",
          "If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator -- government wants -- Senator Obama wants government to do the job.",
          "Look, I fully recognize I'm not of Washington.",
          "We've got to do that in Washington.",
          "The president can't order Congress around.",
          "So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress.",
          "But Washington is a tough town.",
          "Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.",
          "Most people that are lobbying are lobbying the Congress.",
          "But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest.",
          "The plans are all over Washington.",
          "I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.",
          "And the way we're going to get it done is we're going to have a brand new Congress.",
          "We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff.",
          "That's why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago.",
          "That's why we need a Democratic administration in Washington in 1989.",
          "And Senator Obama, it's good to be with you at a town hall meeting.",
          "What's wrong with limiting the terms of members of Congress to 12?",
          "Who's he gonna listen to -- us or the folks running up and down the aisles with money, the lobbyists, the PAC money?",
          "-- because we're going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people.",
          "And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.",
          "There's been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C.",
          "We've had several fragmentary efforts by members of the Congress and by - by private citizens.",
          "It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.",
          "And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment.",
          "There's going to be a new Congress because the old one -- I don't want to get this man made at me -- but there was a post office scandal and a bank scandal.",
          "And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh - the American people, the Congress have been excluded.",
          "I don't have an indoor gymnasium and an indoor tennis and an indoor every other thing they can think of; I don't have a place where I can go make free TV to send to my constituents to try to brainwash them to elect me the next time.",
          "Now, these are all positions of the ACLU.",
          "You own this country but you have no voice in it the way it's organized now, and if you want to have a high risk experience, comparable to bungee jumping, go into Congress some time when they're working on this kind of legislation, when the lobbyists are running up and down the halls.",
          "And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don't.",
          "I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.",
          "While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.",
          "If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.",
          "I also presented to the Congress and they adopted a large package of quality-of-life improvements, which are very important.",
          "It's ad hoc, it's sort of we get up in the morning and read the papers, what country's in trouble, we'll have a meeting."

          "And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.",
          "It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns.",

          "And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.",

          "Secondly, what we need to make sure that each and every one of these criminals understand is that the laws apply to everybody, and when Hunter Biden fills out a fake application, a false application, for a gun permit, and then is facing a 10-year mandatory minimum, which was mandated by legislation sponsored by his father, and then you have a Justice Department that walks away from those charges.",

          "Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.",
          "But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them.",
          "I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.",

          "Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core.",

          "I want to bring that change to the American people.",
          "And I'm sorry, but demonstrating -- it's not a question of patriotism.",
          "So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it.",
          "And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this.",

          "I think the American people want it now.",
          "To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.",
          "And that is one of the challenges that America faces.",
          "It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more.",
          "This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people.",
          "There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.",
          "For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to.",
          "But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.",
          "I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.",

          "Not just to you, but to the entire nation.",
          "I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.",
          "This is a very important country to us.",
          "These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.",
          "Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.",
          "But instead, we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events.",
          "And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.",
          "But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.",
          "But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.",
          "And I have said again and again and again let's get off mud wrestling, let's get off personalities and let's talk about jobs, health care, crime, the things that concern the American people.",

          "But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard.",
          "Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.",
          "We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home.",
          "And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore.",

          "America can help that happen.",
          "We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.",
          "And the American people are willing to have fair, shared sacrifice.",
          "It doesn't speak to the equality of America.",
          "The US is doing better than a lot.",
          "That's in America's national interest and that will be the case so long as I'm president.",
          "Well, it's been a privilege to be able to talk to the American people tonight.",
          "America has not been standing still.",
          "This is a man whose plan excludes 50 million Americans.",
          "My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America.",
          "I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.",
          "If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us.",
          "And we have to change in this country.",
          "Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on.",
          "America and Americans decide not just what's happening in this country.",
          "And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.",
          "The United States is a strong country.",
          "I'm much more optimistic about this country than some.",
          "But we're so, turned so inward we don't understand the global picture.",
          "The interests of the American people must be at stake.",
          "America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.",
          "With the United States, as he said, not so much.",
          "My fellow Americans, as you heard from Bob Schieffer a moment ago, America is being tested by division.",
          "And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.",
          "I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.",
          "I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America.",
          "I believe America's best days are ahead of us.",
          "Not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better America as we go into the next century.",
          "It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.",
          "And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight.",
          "That is the present American position.",
          "This is in our country, folks, the United States of America.",
          "And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow.",
          "What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there.",
          "I think the American people deserve better than they're getting.",
          "That wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.",
          "I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them.",
          "And I think it's very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good.",
          "America owes you a debt of gratitude.",
          "And this is the greatest country on Earth.",
          "This is not the America that we've known in the past.",
          "Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.",
          "They put up the American flag.",
          "This is a patriotism check.",
          "This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not.",
          "My fellow Americans, as I've said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much.",
          "And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.",
          "This is a very important moment in the history of our country.",
          "And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies.",
          "The American people don't know what those commitments are.",
          "I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history.",
          "Our diversity is a strength.",
          "And we'll continue to promote freedom around the world.",
          "These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.",
          "Our people feel that we've lost something precious.",
          "They're suffering in this country.",
          "Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us.",
          "If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us.",
          "I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.",
          "I owe everything to you, the people of this country.",
          "You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.",
          "Which our country should do, too.",
          "The best America is yet to come.",
          "Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process.",
          "America remains the one indispensable nation.",
          "I don't look on it personally as relevant, and I consider it really a waste of time tonight, when you consider the issues that face our country right now.",
          "But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker.",
          "The issue is the American people should speak.",
          "I want my fellow Americans to hear one more time.",
          "We can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.",
          "And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States.",
          "We must rebuild America's strength at home.",
          "This -- this is a critical opportunity for America.",
          "It's time for our nation to come together and do what's right for the people, and I think this is right for the people.",
          "I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be.",
          "We're not looking for a new national identity.",
          "... but we believed that we could make the country better.",
          "America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible.",
          "I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.",
          "But in any event, I think we just look at the facts.",
          "Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.",
          "On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.",
          "We're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time.",
          "I think this is a great country, because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better.",
          "We've lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people.",
          "And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.",
          "You've got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we can't turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.",
          "I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again.",
          "The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say.",
          "That there is some resentment of U.S. power.",
          "Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.",
          "... because it's an important part of the American experience.",
          "2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.",
          "Now that will change America.",
          "If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider.",
          "And it's -- our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and that's why we have to be humble.",
          "We're ahead of all of the Western European country.",
          "We've got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them.",
          "Most Americans believe in basic values.",
          "If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence.",
          "(Laughter) And so our America 2000 program also says this.",
          "Is it in our nation's interests?",
          "My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.",
          "They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong?",
          "I think the American people are too.",
          "That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.",
          "You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.",
          "I think it's time America started moving again.",
          "But we cannot guarantee equal results in America.",
          "The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy.",
          "An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them.",
          "And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet.",
          "That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.",
          "I don't think top-down works in America.",
          "We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.",
          "I don't think we agree on that.",
          "It has not worked for America.",
          "The average uh American person can't do it.",
          "Perhaps in no area do we disagree more than this administration's policies on human rights.",
          "And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked.",
          "Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about \"what about American prestige abroad\": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be.",
          "Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans.",
          "Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.",
          "And unfortunately, that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul.",
          "Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.",
          "So what I'm trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world.",
          "I believe in the American dream.",
          "And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny.",
          "And I don't think most Americans could do that.",
          "I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.",
          "That is not good for America's position in the world, and the world notices.",
          "So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.",
          "But they're basically American, I believe in them.",
          "But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world.",
          "But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it.",
          "We're America, and we believe in our future and we know we have the ability to shape our future.",
          "I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we're on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future.",
          "It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century.",
          "But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there's some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well.",
          "-- because if the American people send me there, we'll get it done.",
          "Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is \"Make America Great Again,\" I wonder when he thought America was great.",
          "The American people want arms control.",
          "Well, I support our democracy.",
          "We have a divided nation.",
          "I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.",
          "And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America.",
          "This is a great country.",
          "I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.",
          "Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation.",
          "So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.",
          "I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.",
          "They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything.",
          "I didn't question the man's patriotism.",
          "Now that isn't the test of whether America moves.",
          "And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.",
          "I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country.",
          "It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy.",
          "And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.",
          "They're doing it all over America because they have to.",
          "There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.",
          "What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone.",
          "Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.",
          "The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.",
          "Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty."

          "And the way to do that is to increase our exports.",

          "Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.",

          "And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.",
          "And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.",

          "It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term.",
          "How about the growth of the economy?",
          "But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going.",
          "And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.",
          "But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy.",
          "And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help.",
          "But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.",
          "I would uh - also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain.",
          "But every economist - liberal, conservative that I'm familiar with - recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh - the first quarter of next year that we'll have an increase in real GNP.",
          "Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.",
          "Economic growth is the key to the future of this country.",
          "9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.",
          "That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy.",
          "Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.",
          "We've got to pay it off and build money to renew it- -spend money to renew it, and that's going to take a growing, expanding job base.",
          "We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world.",
          "So their economy is in a shambles.",
          "They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad.",
          "It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.",
          "I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food.",
          "I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.",
          "I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it's in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years.",
          "Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.",
          "And this decision you're about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying I'm going to go fix it but what are we going to do?",
          "... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.",
          "Now, see, we practice 19th century capitalism.",
          "Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.",
          "Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is.",
          "I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.",
          "If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy?",
          "A growing, expanding job base to generate the funds and the tax revenues to pay off the mess and rebuild America.",
          "Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.",
          "If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.",
          "And so the fundamental question of this campaign is: Who's going to keep the economy growing so people can work?",
          "We also have to make the economy fairer.",
          "It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.",
          "I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.",
          "Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.",
          "You know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing.",
          "What the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies.",
          "We've got to create the products of the future.",
          "But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it.",
          "One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country.",
          "We're going to do that with an economic package.",
          "And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing.",
          "We've got a great economic package which I hope we will discuss later.",
          "I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.",
          "Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again.",
          "Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.",
          "And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion.",
          "We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.",
          "This -- we have weakened our economy.",
          "And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay.",
          "We're the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties we're having.",
          "In some cases, we are going to have to invest.",
          "And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.",
          "We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again.",
          "We can get this economy going again.",
          "Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.",
          "I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.",
          "There's no easy way to do this when you're dealing with an economy that's traditionally been more closed than one that's traditionally been more open.",
          "That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.",
          "And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.",
          "We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.",
          "Well, Andrea, you didn't predicate that lack of economists' support for what I call a flexible freeze, because some good very good economists do support that concept.",
          "And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.",

          "I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.",
          "On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go.",
          "If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.",
          "So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?",
          "And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.",
          "It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.",
          "We've had 12 years of trickle down economics.",

          "I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.",
          "It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.",
          "I'll get our incomes up.",
          "But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it.",
          "Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that.",
          "We're going to grow the economy.",

          "I'm looking at our economic plan because I'm concerned about the future for young people.",
          "First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.",
          "So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.",
          "Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.",
          "And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.",
          "Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families?",
          "Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.",
          "We talked about the economy is more important.",

          "Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.",
          "I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.",

          "We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy.",
          "I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.",
          "I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.",
          "We don't have modernization now.",
          "And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.",

          "No, I am confident about the American economy.",
          "And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security.",
          "And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home.",
          "I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.",
          "And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future.",

          "But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies.",
          "And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.",
          "We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.",
          "It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.",

          "High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.",
          "It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.",
          "And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.",
          "I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things.",
          "But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.",

          "He said it would hurt the economy.",
          "But we now have an economy that, for the first time -- well, let's put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent.",
          "We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.",
          "First question is what's in the best interests of the United States?",
          "We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.",
          "Maybe we will have another debate on the economy.",
          "I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again.",
          "So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.",
          "We've become almost a welfare state.",

          "It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.",
          "We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing.",

          "It's what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like.",
          "And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.",
          "The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.",
          "And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.",

          "It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.",
          "And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.",

          "Our economic strength is still there.",
          "And talk about the economy.",
          "Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.",
          "What I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we're facing, if we're going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if we're going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, we're going to have to be able to work together.",

          "This from Wall Street and I'll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.",
          "It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs.",
          "The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.",
          "As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.",

          "So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base.",

          "There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant.",
          "The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.",
          "We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States.",
          "That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.",
          "You're seeing it right now in the economy.",
          "And we've -- you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.",
          "But my economic program is the kind of change we want.",
          "I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy.",
          "Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.",
          "Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management.",
          "It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business.",
          "I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.",
          "Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.",
          "It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.",
          "So I want to make sure that we make -- we make America more competitive.",
          "This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy.",
          "Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.",
          "I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can't have any tax cut that's not paid for.",
          "So this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions.",
          "Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism.",
          "Now I've come out with a new agenda for America's renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy.",
          "The answer is to invest and grow this economy.",
          "But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans.",
          "And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.",
          "And therefore, it seems to me that we should hold the lid, as we have, to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are - five out of six in this economy.",
          "But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.",
          "Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America.",
          "And I'll keep my word on the economic package.",
          "And another one is: stimulate investment and savings.",
          "In my economic plan we increase it 39percent.",
          "Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period.",
          "How strong is our economy?",
          "In spite of the economic problems, we're the most respected economy around the world.",
          "I think we need to invest and save more.",
          "We've got to invest and grow.",
          "Invest in American jobs, American education, control health care costs, bring this country together again.",
          "If we're not an economic superpower, we're a used to be and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world.",
          "We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.",
          "I want to keep this economic recovery going.",
          "But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we're not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.",
          "I think that grows the economy.",
          "We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.",
          "It's not trickle down economics.",
          "I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.",
          "I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.",
          "Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping.",
          "Over the next four years, we'll make sure the economy continues to grow.",
          "The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.",
          "So, in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.",
          "They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market.",
          "But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.",
          "When we do that, and we allow that innovation, that's when it'll get back.",
          "We need a good strong economic package, let the private sector creates the jobs and they can do it.",
          "I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform.",
          "He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today.",
          "We need a strong economy.",
          "Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.",
          "Not only that, he said, \"I think that's what grows the economy.\"",
          "If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world.",
          "It didn't hurt the economy.",
          "Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.",
          "And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.",
          "So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.",
          "And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.",
          "So 80% -- now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%.",
          "I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families.",
          "That's why we want an economic package.",
          "But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country.",
          "So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open."

          "But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.",
          "But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan.",
          "We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11.",
          "And Senator Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words.",
          "Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.",
          "We see in -- in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against -- against our people there, four people dead.",
          "And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden.",
          "We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops.",
          "We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.",
          "And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.",
          "We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
          "Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president.",
          "Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend.",
          "We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began.",
          "So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.",
          "Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.",
          "Osama bin Laden doesn't get to decide.",
          "Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.",
          "I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.",
          "Of course, we're going to find Osama bin Laden.",
          "And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" and we brought him to justice.",
          "We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.",
          "The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world's opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times.",
          "I'm optimistic that we'll win the war on terror, but I understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose.",
          "We hadn't caught bin Laden.",
          "They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.",
          "That's part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Senator McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn't that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly.",
          "And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us.",
          "What I said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say, which is, if Pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin Laden and take him out, then we should.",
          "And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general.",
          "And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.",
          "I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation's interest.",
          "Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.",
          "And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.",
          "We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.",
          "And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.",
          "I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends.",
          "But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.",
          "They're going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go.",
          "That's part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us.",
          "I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.",
          "You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.",
          "The Taliban came back in, Al Qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war.",
          "You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman.",
          "Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden.",
          "Well, the invasion of Afghanistan didn't take place on our watch.",
          "I think it's worth it, because I think -- I know in the long term a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, will set such a powerful example in a part of the world that's desperate for freedom.",
          "But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.",
          "I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.",
          "But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man.",
          "Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan.",
          "And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War.",
          "And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.",
          "Because I understand the stakes of this war on terror.",
          "They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country.",
          "But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.",
          "That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.",
          "There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.",
          "As a matter of fact, the tools now given to the terrorist fighters are the same tools that we've been using against drug dealers and white-collar criminals.",
          "I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.",
          "Osama bin Laden attacked us.",
          "Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist.",
          "But who's going to get Mosul, really?",
          "This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya.",
          "This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.",
          "And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission.",
          "The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.",
          "So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014.",
          "And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.",
          "This is not mud slinging.",
          "There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.",
          "I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?",
          "Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?",
          "As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend.",
          "And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.",
          "You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.",
          "Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.",
          "When you announce that you're going to launch an attack into another country, it's pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us.",
          "This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.",
          "Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, \"Where is Osama bin Laden? \"",
          "You know, we went on the Libyan raid -- do you remember that one?",
          "But on the big questions, about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, I'll stand by those decisions, because I think they're right.",
          "But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.",
          "After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.",
          "First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.",
          "And that's what's happening in Afghanistan and Iraq.",
          "You can't do that and expect to win the war on terror.",
          "About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.",
          "It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.",
          "But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?",
          "Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people.",
          "We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.",
          "And that's what Osama bin Laden's handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan.",
          "That's the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains.",
          "And secondly, it's a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only Osama bin Laden.",
          "And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him.",
          "We washed our hands of Afghanistan.",
          "There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and we're going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014.",
          "I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.",
          "And in order to have the best intelligence in the world to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what they're plotting, you've got to have the best cooperation you've ever had in the world.",
          "If he'd let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldn't have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden.",
          "And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.",
          "I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.",
          "Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.",
          "We then started to build up Afghan forces.",
          "And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror.",
          "And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.",
          "In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there.",
          "But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.",
          "This is the person who, after we had -- we hadn't even finished Afghanistan, where he said, \"Next up, Baghdad.\"",
          "When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize.",
          "I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide.",
          "Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.",
          "The president moved the troops, so he's got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is.",
          "But to say that there's only one focus on the war on terror doesn't really understand the nature of the war on terror.",
          "As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that's where it will end.",
          "Because inside Pakistan, you have a -- a large group of Pashtun that are -- that are Taliban.",
          "It's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.",
          "But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.",
          "You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan.",
          "And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.",
          "We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis.",
          "We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror.",
          "In Libya we stood on the side of the people.",
          "That's what the war on terror is about.",
          "Is -- is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?",
          "And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.",
          "I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing.",
          "And we want a democracy in Afghanistan.",
          "So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.",
          "Seventy-five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice.",
          "He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.",
          "We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida.",
          "It's important for the success of Afghanistan.",
          "And I've said this to President Karzai.",
          "Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.",
          "And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us.",
          "We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan.",
          "We -- we had to go into Pakistan.",
          "When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade.",
          "Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued.",
          "And I -- I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.",
          "Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?",
          "Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election.",
          "First of all, of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us.",
          "There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.",
          "That's why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us.",
          "We've got to be tough on international terrorism.",
          "Ladies and gentlemen, the right war was Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan.",
          "We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.",
          "The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office.",
          "And so we decimated Al Qaida's core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
          "I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.",
          "But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama's plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.",
          "So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.",
          "I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government.",
          "And when we had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1,000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains.",
          "And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the -- in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem.",
          "But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.",
          "So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.",
          "These terrorists are serious, they're deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill.",
          "That's the war against terror.",
          "We drove the Russians out with -- the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake.",
          "The goal here is to take back Mosul.",
          "They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them.",
          "General McKiernan, the commander in Afghanistan right now, is desperate for more help, because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive Afghan -- Taliban offenses.",
          "So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.",
          "In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends.",
          "First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened.",
          "When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped.",
          "And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.",
          "Katie, it's a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan.",
          "We need to be stronger on terrorism.",
          "We have to double the size of the Afghan army.",
          "I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda.",
          "The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too.",
          "We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people.",
          "And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.",
          "At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can \"muddle through\" Afghanistan.",
          "So I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again.",
          "Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden.",
          "And you cannot change positions in this war on terror if you expect to win.",
          "We can't coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.",
          "I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.",
          "They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didn't.",
          "That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.",
          "But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein's threatened invasion of Kuwait.",
          "And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.",
          "We've been there a long time, and we've got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need.",
          "And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein.",
          "And as a consequence, Al Qaeda's core leadership has been decimated.",
          "That's the enemy that attacked us.",
          "They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation.",
          "And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.",
          "And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.",
          "And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic.",
          "And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead.",
          "Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.",
          "And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.",
          "Well, Prime Minister Allawi was here.",
          "The terrorists have won each time.",
          "As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the -- the insurgents are highly disparate.",
          "We convinced Libya to disarm.",
          "But I said they have to focus on terror, also.",
          "I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.",
          "You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9/11 happened.",
          "If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.",
          "You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, \"Well, this is just a grand diversion.\"",
          "Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs.",
          "On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do.",
          "We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.",
          "You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden.",
          "And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East.",
          "We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.",
          "No attack ever created a job or educated a child, or helped a family make ends meet.",
          "And the reason Pakistan -- the popular opinion of America had diminished in Pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator, Musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties.",
          "Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan?",
          "We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden.",
          "And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.",
          "We've upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terrorist.",
          "So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.",
          "He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.",
          "And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.",
          "And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.",
          "We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction.",
          "You tell Tony Blair we're going alone.",
          "Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?",
          "Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan.",
          "Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.",
          "But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism.",
          "This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.",
          "I congratulate him on -- on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.",
          "That's why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you're just as guilty as the terrorist.",
          "We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide.",
          "The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.",
          "We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.",
          "What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.",
          "So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.",
          "And in the meantime, they weren't going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.",
          "It's wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy.",
          "And, you know, Governor Romney, I'm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.",
          "We announce we're going after Mosul.",
          "And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.",
          "And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.",
          "In addition, we're now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security.",
          "In fact, he said he wants to announce that he's going to attack Pakistan.",
          "Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.",
          "Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support.",
          "We've been successful in Afghanistan.",
          "We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan.",
          "And Pakistan is a very important element in this.",
          "Osama bin Laden isn't going to determine how we defend ourselves.",
          "And the Taliban are no longer in power.",
          "This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress.",
          "And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan.",
          "We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn't stay there.",
          "We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan.",
          "After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.",
          "And right now, as you know, the US took the lead in a no-fly operation up there in-- no- fly order up in the United Nations.",
          "So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan.",
          "So we're now going to take Mosul.",
          "Between the World Trade Center bombing in, what was it, 1993 or so, and the next time was five years, seven years.",
          "Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow.",
          "They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.",
          "Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan.",
          "This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and we're now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs.",
          "And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.",
          "They've intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban.",
          "We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, \"You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary.\"",
          "So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.",
          "In the hands of a terrorist enemy.",
          "And that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.",
          "And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out.",
          "Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan.",
          "We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan.",
          "I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have.",
          "And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.",
          "We'll stay on the hunt on Al Qaida.",
          "And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today.",
          "That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.",
          "Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.",
          "So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.",
          "In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over."

          "So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.",
          "Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.",
          "We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.",
          "Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there.",
          "It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.",
          "Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.",
          "There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.",
          "Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place a long time.",
          "Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent.",
          "The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.",
          "And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat.",
          "The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.",
          "When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.",
          "If - Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country - but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war.",
          "It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face.",
          "But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.",
          "Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally -- the Shah of Iran.",
          "As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s.",
          "It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.",
          "And that's the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.",
          "And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.",
          "Many of them are now the contras.",
          "We would have had sanctions.",
          "And the -- the challenge we have -- I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy -- but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong.",
          "If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.",
          "It's a great question about Iran.",
          "The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence.",
          "We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran, that might be of a warlike nature.",
          "And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.",
          "He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.",
          "And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now.",
          "And finally, we were a party to the convention -- to working with Germany, France and Great Britain to send their foreign ministers into Iran.",
          "He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.",
          "First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.",
          "It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.",
          "And Iran is killing ISIS.",
          "When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.",
          "There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.",
          "I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.",
          "Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we've already sanctioned Iran.",
          "We need to indict Ahmadinejad.",
          "And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.",
          "Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now.",
          "We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.",
          "They were choking on the sanctions.",
          "One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.",
          "Well, I'll tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran.",
          "Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad.",
          "And Iran and Iraq are now more dangerous -- Iran and North Korea are now more dangerous.",
          "As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.",
          "We were the first ones to put sanctions on.",
          "Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition.",
          "We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.",
          "It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.",
          "What I'd also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran.",
          "We do need tougher sanctions.",
          "And that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis.",
          "There are sanctions in place on Iran.",
          "And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.",
          "I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.",
          "Pakistan is -- is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now.",
          "The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.",
          "I would tighten those sanctions further.",
          "We've mobilized sanctions against that government.",
          "The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally.",
          "We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a -- a -- a solution to this, which says -- which stops this -- this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America.",
          "Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don't change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences.",
          "Even in Iran they have had an election that began to bring about some change.",
          "Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country.",
          "Look, I look at what's happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb.",
          "Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.",
          "Now, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that.",
          "I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it, but that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions.",
          "We have got to undo what Trump did, bring that coalition together, and make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.",
          "We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon.",
          "Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, Ã¢â€°Â¥Mr.",
          "Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran.",
          "And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.",
          "My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.",
          "It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us.",
          "So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.",
          "Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.",
          "We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on.",
          "Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.",
          "Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy.",
          "If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too.",
          "Iran continued to sell oil to the United States.",
          "I think there's a great difference between the Government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel, and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on.",
          "The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues.",
          "Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.",
          "So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior.",
          "On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.",
          "Iran is taking over Iraq.",
          "Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America.",
          "Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they're doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs.",
          "Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.",
          "Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.",
          "And we have maintained the sanctions.",
          "It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea.",
          "It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.",
          "Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.",
          "We don't have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems.",
          "Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream.",
          "And our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and it's a great threat.",
          "We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.",
          "Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors.",
          "In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries.",
          "And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow.",
          "Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.",
          "Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran.",
          "Iran now and Russia are now against us.",
          "The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.",
          "But again, the test or the difference between us, the president has had four years to try to do something about it, and North Korea has got more weapons; Iran is moving towards weapons.",
          "I would say I didn't hear what Yassir Arafat had to say, but I don't want to -- you know, I think foreign policy, I want to be very careful about, and I'm not here to argue about the President with some ongoing foreign policy matter.",
          "I don't think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee.",
          "Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions.",
          "And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we've got real (inaudible).",
          "I do not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.",
          "I will partner with Israel to make sure Iran never is nuclear-armed.",
          "I'd make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention.",
          "And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we've put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever.",
          "But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.",
          "I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they've already made.",
          "With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran.",
          "I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can't come into our ports.",
          "My issue is that, because of the actions of Donald Trump, we are in a situation where they are now starting -- Iran is starting to enrich uranium again in violation of the original agreement.",
          "A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran.",
          "We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.",
          "And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible.",
          "With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.",
          "We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, \"We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,\" and we say, \"No, you're not\"?",
          "Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.",
          "And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.",
          "I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.",
          "And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel's national security.",
          "There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror.",
          "Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.",
          "Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000.",
          "And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year, he'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran.",
          "Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad.",
          "Iran is taking over Iraq.",
          "Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.",
          "But to the issue of Iran, as long as I'm president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.",
          "And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.",
          "It would've been inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo.",
          "That's the kind of mindset that says sanctions were working.",
          "And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.",
          "They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology.",
          "Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union.",
          "I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior.",
          "The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.",
          "I mean, I'm -- I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program.",
          "But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.",
          "You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb?",
          "And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq.",
          "We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.",
          "I believe that Governor Carter doesn't realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran.",
          "And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.",
          "But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.",
          "The sanctions are being violated.",
          "All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges.",
          "But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.",
          "I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren't here then either.",
          "We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy.",
          "I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.",
          "Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and that's exactly what I'm talking about.",
          "And Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons.",
          "Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?",
          "Back to Iran, just for a second.",
          "And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power.",
          "Iran has power over North Korea."

          "I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned.",
          "And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.",

          "He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there.",
          "We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.",

          "And so I believe the answer is, I'm going to win it because I'm getting into focus my agenda for America's renewal, and also I think that Governor Clinton's had pretty much of a free ride.",
          "I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.",
          "Of -- Hillary Clinton got 3 million votes, more votes than Trump.",

          "It means you have a fraudulent election.",

          "They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth.",
          "I think you're right that the polls show that the majority of Hispanics want that bill, so I'm not doing it for political reasons.",
          "And that is the current campaign financing system.",
          "It's been a very tough campaign.",
          "How can Barry Goldwater sitting in Arizona know whether I'm talking on the issues or not when we put out position paper after position paper, he puts out position paper after position paper; and we see this much about it, because everyone else is fascinated with polls and who's up or down today and who's going to be up or down tomorrow.",
          "It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate.",
          "And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.",

          "And by the way, our military--they've been voting by ballots for since the end of the Civil War, in effect.",
          "And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that's what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.",
          "It's important we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future.",
          "That's what the election's about.",
          "The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.",

          "As I said the other night, I hope a lot of them lose because they're liberal Democrats --",
          "So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.",
          "And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.",

          "Proud that they voted hopefully for me.",
          "And that is to get the support of the people.",
          "So that really isn't an issue in this campaign.",

          "Coming from the political process.",
          "I'm asking for your vote.",
          "And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.",
          "That's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll continue to be all about.",
          "That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for.",
          "Now, we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy.",
          "So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.",
          "We both made promises in this campaign.",
          "So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them.",
          "And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.",

          "Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point.",
          "I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.",
          "I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.",
          "Now, as far as running away from my party is concerned, Senator Kennedy has said that we have no compassion for the poor, that we are against progress - the enemies of progress, is the term that he's used, and the like.",
          "Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?",
          "Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done.",
          "And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead.",
          "Now, I believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world - not just America - perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has already indicated, the most important election in our history - it isn't the label that he wears or that I wear that counts.",
          "Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America.",
          "I mean, we can remember when President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis sent his secretary of state to Paris to meet with DeGaulle.",
          "When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, \"Any place, any time,\" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas.",
          "That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.",
          "I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy's advan- advice to go - go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did - said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists.",
          "I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.",
          "Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures.",
          "I don't think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world.",
          "And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.",
          "Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.",
          "And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, \"I'm not running to be a Catholic president.",
          "We're quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy's suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong.",
          "Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way.",
          "And it's now the smallest number that we have had since the -- the smallest in size since John Kennedy's administration.",
          "And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.",
          "I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes.",
          "Well, I would say first of all that Senator's - Kennedy's statement that he's just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn't going to help our prestige either.",
          "I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.",
          "I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.",
          "Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.",
          "But it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.",
          "What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president?",
          "When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has - has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead.",
          "As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that - to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans.",
          "I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt.",
          "Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.",
          "I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.",
          "I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.",
          "I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend.",
          "Senator Kennedy's position and mine completely different on this.",
          "But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.",
          "Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.",
          "And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.",
          "Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.",
          "I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign.",
          "That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations - recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard - recommendations with regard to - again - slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if - in effect, to the Communists.",
          "And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.",
          "The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate.",
          "I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth.",
          "The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.",
          "Now looking at Senator Kennedy's credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will.",
          "I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.",
          "We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right.",
          "That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.",
          "I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.",
          "Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again.",
          "Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism.",
          "But let me say this, because he spent millions and millions of dollars of advertising on the subject of Boston Harbor.",
          "Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.",
          "Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy.",
          "I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, \"Vote for me because I'm a Democrat.\"",
          "Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba.",
          "Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy's last answer.",
          "I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.",
          "Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.",
          "Senator Kennedy is in the hospital.",
          "I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.",
          "As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.",
          "Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?",
          "Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.",
          "Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.",
          "I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.",
          "I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.",
          "We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one.",
          "28 years ago, as a young man just graduated from law school, I came to this city, came clear across the country, to watch John Kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the United States, right here in Los Angeles.",
          "Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.",
          "And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget.",
          "I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.",
          "I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.",
          "It's understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement.",
          "I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.",
          "We're ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied.",
          "And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.",
          "Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still.",
          "First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik.",
          "Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States.",
          "Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life.",
          "America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.",
          "I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents.",
          "The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.",
          "If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question.",
          "Now I'm very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind.",
          "Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.",
          "Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?",
          "Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred.",
          "I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.",
          "The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says it's not.",
          "Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future.",
          "I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.",
          "First, the National Journal named Senator Kennedy the most liberal senator of all.",
          "If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation.",
          "Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans.",
          "Do you remember the Senator from Boston chanting out there and the ridicule factor from that lady from Texas that was on there; I mean, come on, this was just outrageous.",
          "This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.",
          "The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy.",
          "I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.",
          "And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.",
          "I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.",
          "Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright.",
          "Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.",
          "President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, \"We are great, but we can be greater.''",
          "And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.",
          "And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.",
          "That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done.",
          "Of course, both er - Senator Kennedy and I have felt Mr. Truman's ire; and uh - consequently, I think he can speak with some feeling on this subject.",
          "From the standpoint of MR, KENNEDY: Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas."

          "This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.",
          "It's important, it's their future.",
          "And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.",
          "If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.",

          "Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.",

          "Now, you've shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that.",
          "But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.",
          "Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.",
          "What we do is we have choice.",
          "Let me make sure you understand my decision.",
          "When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you're deciding the future of the world.",
          "And let's talk about people we do control.",
          "If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages.",

          "But you've also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes.",
          "And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.",
          "I don't take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what I've tried to do to work with others to make good things happen.",
          "I think it depends on what we do.",
          "We can't get involved in the quagmire, but we must do what we can.",
          "You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.",
          "We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.",
          "First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past.",
          "I have made a lot of decisions, and some of them little, like appointments to boards you never heard of, and some of them big.",
          "I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.",
          "So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it.",
          "We need to have accountability.",
          "I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another.",
          "It's what are our capabilities.",
          "We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.",
          "And I may have to make those tough decisions.",
          "For those of you making up your mind, I would be honored to have your support.",
          "Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I don't know yet.",
          "I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice.",
          "But it is very important.",
          "I know the morality that's prompting that question, and I respect it enormously.",
          "And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, they've never been carried out.",
          "I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.",
          "I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.",
          "And so I'm proud of my choice.",
          "So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices.",
          "I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies.",

          "It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.",
          "I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.",
          "But I think we've got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science.",
          "It's in this way, by making wise choices, that we're stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control.",
          "And thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision.",
          "Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.",
          "And the other thing I think is important...",
          "And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.",
          "I believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded.",
          "Now, just because we don't want to get involved everywhere doesn't mean we should back off anywhere it comes up.",
          "I think it should be voluntary.",
          "That's why I fight for equality and justice.",
          "And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.",
          "The private market and individual responsibility always work best.",
          "And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility.",
          "We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives.",
          "I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.",
          "As a matter of fact, I wouldn't support it if I thought that.",
          "Somehow we've lost that accountability.",
          "It's not the right thing to do.",
          "And secondly, like my opponent, I don't agree we ought to have quotas.",
          "A promise made will be a promise kept.",
          "May I disagree with the premise of your question?",
          "And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility.",
          "And if a crisis comes up, I ask who has the judgment and the experience and, yes, the character to make the right decision?",
          "To destroy life to save life is -- it's one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face.",
          "I just think that we ought to support the decision.",
          "And that's why it is essential we not leave.",
          "But we can't just provide moral support.",
          "But here's something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you're talking about.",
          "And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.",
          "I had to make the decision to destroy more life, so do we continue to destroy life -- I made the decision to balance science and ethics.",
          "But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.",
          "Let's go back in terms of accepting responsibility for your actions.",
          "Instead let people make their own choice.",
          "That's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.",
          "They should be judged on their qualifications.",
          "And I think that this is so important.",
          "I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.",
          "Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion.",
          "We need to stand for human rights.",
          "But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.",
          "That is priority one in this country.",
          "I think we have to make the right and responsible choices.",
          "...the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life?",
          "I have -- I understand everybody in this country doesn't agree with the decisions I've made.",
          "It's the right thing for the consumers.",
          "You can decide which of us you think are right.",
          "I think people need to be held responsible for the actions they take in life.",
          "We have to respect one another.",
          "And I think that this uh - is one example where uh - a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now.",
          "But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.",
          "And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place.",
          "I don't think that's true, but you know, let others fire away on it.",
          "I'm not going to be a picker and chooser.",
          "This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.",
          "The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.",
          "I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.",
          "I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.",
          "But there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action.",
          "I believe we can set our priorities.",
          "They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.",
          "It just takes - from the people.",
          "I don't think that's a bad decision.",
          "We have millions of people that did it the right way.",
          "But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.",
          "They see ethical problems in the Whitehouse today.",
          "Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability.",
          "You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.",
          "Now those are the wrong priorities.",

          "Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere.",
          "And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century.",
          "I will keep this nation strong.",
          "Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?",
          "We have a delicate, tight-wire walk that we must go through at the present time to make sure that we do not cozy up to tyrants, to make sure that they don't get the impression that they can suppress their people.",
          "Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.",
          "They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.",
          "People want to be safe.",
          "But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense.",
          "We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.",
          "You go to the heart of America's worries tonight.",
          "I am concerned about what that does to our future.",
          "And I will not stop in our efforts to hunt down and kill the terrorists.",
          "So we can do a better job of homeland security.",
          "That's why we have to continue to be alert.",
          "And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again.",
          "The Patriot Act is vital, by the way.",
          "Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions.",
          "And are they good for our national security?",
          "In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.",
          "But I'll never fail to protect the United States of America.",
          "And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good.",
          "I want to restore a meaningful safety net.",
          "The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?",
          "And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.",
          "We're protecting people, they have to pay up.",
          "What I've said is that we have to store it safely.",
          "Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take them out of the picture.",
          "If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.",
          "There are certainly dangers there, there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the US.",
          "There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security.",
          "Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?",
          "And we can do so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been getting that support, and do it in a way which will bring down violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs that's pouring into the country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods.",
          "Will we ever be safe and secure again?",
          "And we've got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don't ever torture a prisoner ever again.",
          "Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections.",
          "In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation.",
          "And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.",
          "But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.",
          "But we are protecting both of them.",
          "Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.",
          "The one thing I'm for is a safe society.",
          "And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.",
          "And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.",
          "I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.",
          "It's for their security as well as ours.",
          "Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries.",
          "This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.",
          "The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense.",
          "But our long-term security depends on our deep faith in liberty.",
          "... and reduce our violence.",
          "It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.",
          "But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.",
          "We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure.",
          "And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.",
          "And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security.",
          "But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves.",
          "I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.",
          "First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street.",
          "To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.",
          "It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.",
          "Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.",
          "We have bridges and tunnels that aren't being secured, chemical plants, nuclear plants that aren't secured, hospitals that are overcrowded with their emergency rooms.",
          "I want to remind you that it wasn't just my administration that made the decision on safety.",
          "But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.",
          "And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.",
          "They've been prepared to defend.",
          "So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our independence.",
          "We have made sure that they are isolated.",
          "But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.",
          "But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace.",
          "Now, this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom.",
          "And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.",
          "That, in my view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.",
          "Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world.",
          "Those are the concerns of the people that are watching us tonight.",
          "They don't want to see protectionism.",
          "I know the threats that are made against me.",
          "But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.",
          "We're going to make America safe again.",
          "We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.",
          "But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there.",
          "But we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.",
          "I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.",
          "And we have to stop the violence.",
          "We can put the Communists on the defensive.",
          "And since that day, our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer.",
          "I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.",
          "In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.",
          "I fully understand the threat.",
          "Whether we're going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns.",
          "You don't turn national security into a political issue.",
          "But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.",
          "We cannot protect countries all over the world...",
          "One of the key points in foreign policy and national security policy is the need to re-establish the old-fashioned principle that politics ought to stop at the water's edge.",
          "And we have to be very vigilant.",
          "So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.",
          "Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.",
          "This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past.",
          "Well, it would be if they're given special protective status.",
          "Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.",
          "I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.",
          "So we need more protection from America.",
          "Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake.",
          "An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.",
          "And we're going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.",
          "I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.",
          "Now they have the bombs and we're less safe.",
          "That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country.",
          "We all know the possibility of terrorism.",
          "And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform.",
          "And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.",
          "But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.",
          "We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.",
          "Now, that I think has to be our policy, because they are threatening to kill more Americans.",
          "These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.",
          "But we had also better be darn sure we don't leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.",
          "We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about.",
          "I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we're safe.",
          "The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.",
          "It's driven by, what are we going to need to keep the American people safe?",
          "All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later.",
          "We've got chemical warfare being conducted against our children on the streets in this country all day every day, and we don't have the will to stamp it out.",
          "But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.",
          "Second, we have to face that in this world, economic security is a whole lot of national security.",
          "And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.",
          "America and the world are safer for it.",
          "I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever.",
          "At home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.",
          "What are freedom's chances in those areas?",
          "I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem.",
          "We need to deny them the safe havens.",
          "What should they do about the danger?",
          "The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.",
          "We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.",
          "So we got to be guarded in our generosity.",
          "I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.",
          "That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe.",
          "And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.",
          "To me, that's the best way to secure America.",
          "So we don't have to worry about it.",
          "It is the single greatest threat that this country has.",
          "So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.",
          "The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.",
          "And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.",
          "We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.",
          "How do we prevent attacks?",
          "Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.",
          "The world is more dangerous today.",
          "I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.",
          "So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net.",
          "We were safer before President Bush came to office.",
          "We're on the side of freedom.",
          "Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council.",
          "Why have there been these safety violations?",
          "That is the number-one threat we face in the world.",
          "When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh - just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them.",
          "We'll deny sanctuary to these terrorists.",
          "And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.",
          "And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.",
          "We need to be thinking about cyber security.",
          "We should be providing all the protective gear possible.",
          "So this is a national security issue.",
          "I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them.",
          "The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe.",
          "But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.",
          "We have to remain vigilant, as I just said.",
          "We're going to choose hope over fear.",
          "America needed to be safe.",
          "Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.",
          "There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.",
          "We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.",
          "And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.",
          "The middle-class need a rescue package.",
          "We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.",
          "I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.",
          "The other point I wanna make is about our defense.",
          "That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.",
          "We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.",
          "You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.",
          "But, again, I want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again.",
          "Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.",
          "First of all, the world is still a dangerous and uncertain place.",
          "The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.",
          "And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.",
          "How do we protect our people?",
          "Does that make you feel safer in America?",
          "But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say.",
          "We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...",
          "And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.",
          "But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.",
          "I'm worried about our country.",
          "It hurts communities, because these are our first responders.",
          "The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.",
          "So this is a serious threat.",
          "But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.",
          "Our law enforcement must have every tool necessary to find and disrupt terrorists at home and abroad before they hurt us again.",
          "Can they rely on us?",
          "Are we as strong as we should be?",
          "Senator Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that.",
          "And we better be awfully careful.",
          "So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen.",
          "To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.",
          "Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they're severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals.",
          "There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.",
          "These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.",
          "We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline just as we did back in 1983 and we did it on a bipartisan basis.",
          "Listen, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.",
          "I believe in protecting America first.",
          "So I believe America's less safe.",
          "I will never cede the authority of our country or our security to any other nation.",
          "And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.",
          "And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people.",
          "We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.",
          "I can make American safer than President Bush has made us.",
          "And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.",
          "The question is, are people getting health care, and we have a strong safety net, and there needs to be a safety net in America.",
          "We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.",
          "I would be guarded in my approach.",
          "And what I'm afraid of is we've watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we'll let the U.N. deal with it.",
          "I think that we're showing the proper compassion and concern.",
          "I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.",
          "And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.",
          "I don't think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don't.",
          "We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.",
          "And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails.",
          "More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make.",
          "What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world.",
          "Our inner cities are a disaster.",
          "I'll never turn over America's national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances.",
          "So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.",
          "But you're absolutely correct, it is a threat, it's a huge threat.",
          "We took care of the safety issues.",
          "But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.",
          "Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you \"read my lips\" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country.",
          "The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.",
          "They don't want us to control it, very candidly.",
          "And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.",
          "And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.",
          "If we fail, then freedom fails.",
          "I believe in building safe zones.",
          "I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.",
          "Every time you do that you take a risk.",
          "That has to be our biggest national security priority.",
          "And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.",
          "Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.",
          "I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.",
          "The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses.",
          "That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.",
          "We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism.",
          "IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to protect them.",
          "He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.",
          "Just want to make sure they're safe.",
          "We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.",
          "In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize.",
          "Well, there are various elements of defense.",
          "People are willing to take risks.",
          "After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us.",
          "And this is a safer country.",
          "Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe.",
          "I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America.",
          "I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.",
          "I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.",
          "And we created an OSHA - an Occupational Safety and Health Agency - for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place.",
          "We will continue to stay on the offense.",
          "You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.",
          "My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.",
          "This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it's part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.",
          "So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.",
          "But we will defend the citizens of this country.",
          "They have to make sure that they're cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism.",
          "We're increasing defense reasonably -- not too much, but we are increasing defense some -- because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason.",
          "The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.",
          "And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.",
          "But what we can't do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term.",
          "And by the way, we've also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority.",
          "We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.",
          "Let's not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand.",
          "We must deal with threats before they fully materialize.",
          "But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer.",
          "Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job.",
          "And we'll continue to spread freedom.",
          "The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?",
          "And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.",
          "We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco.",
          "I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.",
          "If we just wore these masks - the President's own advisors have told him - we could save 100,000 lives.",
          "We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.",
          "They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.",
          "And now we are putting up a defense of our own.",
          "All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.",
          "In the two-hundred-year history there's been a very uh - cautious approach to this.",
          "Number three, we do have to make sure that we're protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can't develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing.",
          "The world is more dangerous.",
          "All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.",
          "What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but we're shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America.",
          "My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.",
          "The measurement is not: Are we safer?",
          "We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.",
          "That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.",
          "It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.",
          "If they're safe, they're coming.",
          "We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.",
          "They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.",
          "I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things.",
          "And what I did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe?",
          "These are a few of the things to which our nation is committed, and we will continue with these commitments.",
          "And we will protect people.",
          "If we had a disaster today, could they handle it?",
          "So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.",
          "I think we can save lives.",
          "But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.",
          "We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.",
          "And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.",
          "I've got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you.",
          "And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?"

          "Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate.",
          "And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept.",
          "When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.",
          "Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks.",
          "And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless, economic policies that won't create jobs, won't reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don't have to play by the same rules that you do.",
          "But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.",
          "Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.",
          "And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.",
          "Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get.",
          "So, it's conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess.",
          "Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrong headed policies since I've been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about.",
          "The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he's often talked as if we should take premature military action.",
          "And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.",
          "But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.",
          "Unfortunately, Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it.",
          "Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.",
          "The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.",
          "You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.",
          "But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts.",
          "But, of course, if you're a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney's talking about.",
          "Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \"you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\" you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option.",
          "Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.",
          "Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn't going to help the economy grow.",
          "And I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking.",
          "He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.",
          "Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor.",
          "And, unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.",
          "Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan.",
          "The -- first of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it.",
          "And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs...",
          "And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.",
          "But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well.",
          "Now Governor Romney had a very different response.",
          "You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.",
          "Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.",
          "And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, \"Well Obama didn't try.\"",
          "When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.",
          "So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.",
          "Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign.",
          "I believe Governor Romney is a good man.",
          "It means that Governor Romney...",
          "But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.",
          "Governor Romney, here's what we did.",
          "The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.",
          "Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis.",
          "Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true.",
          "And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.",
          "So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says \"these are imaginary jobs.\"",
          "Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.",
          "And when I hear Governor Romney say he's a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when -- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, \"This plant kills,\" and took great pride in shutting it down.",
          "Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue.",
          "Governor Romney, that's not what you said...",
          "Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.",
          "Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here.",
          "He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he's gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists.",
          "And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate.",
          "Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd be burdened.",
          "When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers, hiring more teachers was important to growing our economy, Governor Romney said that doesn't grow our economy.",
          "Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off.",
          "... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.",
          "In the private sector, Governor Romney's company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing.",
          "In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.",
          "While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that's not how a commander in chief operates.",
          "If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.",
          "Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, \"I will veto the DREAM Act\", that would allow these young people to have access.\"",
          "Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.",
          "Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.",
          "But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works.",
          "And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.",
          "But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.",
          "And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.",
          "And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan?",
          "Well, Governor Romney's right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas.",
          "First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses.",
          "He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones.",
          "Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.",
          "And that -- don't take my word for it, take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney.",
          "And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families.",
          "Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.",
          "Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, \"Bush ought to change his behavior.\"",
          "You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.",
          "I don't think he'll be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and he's offering more of it, and what he's saying about my program is just not true.",
          "Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.",
          "I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after \"read my lips\" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed.",
          "Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?",
          "Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something.",
          "Depends on what he says in the future in the campaign.",
          "Look, Governor Romney's called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he's going to pay for by closing deductions.",
          "And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said \"I'm going to give tax cuts\" -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said \"tax cuts to everybody,\" including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history.",
          "If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China.",
          "Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.",
          "George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy.",
          "So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.",
          "And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?",
          "First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.",
          "There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts.",
          "This is for Governor Romney?",
          "What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesn't have different ideas.",
          "But when -- when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.",
          "Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.",
          "You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue?",

          "Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about.",
          "Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies.",
          "I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.",
          "He voted against these programs, he does not believe it.",
          "Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them."

          "Is America better off than it was 4 years ago?",
          "Now, for four years that's what I worked on.",
          "You had eight years with Obama?",
          "Don't forget that, that happened in 1993.",
          "And what we've seen over the last four years is something I don't want to see over the next four years.",
          "But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.",
          "We had a great time.",
          "They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.",
          "I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.",
          "And months ago, many of us were pressing for action.",
          "Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny.",
          "And I know it's been going on a long time.",
          "We cannot be satisfied with what we've been doing for the last eight years.",
          "That's what I've been doing for the last four years.",
          "And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.",
          "It's now four years later.",
          "And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.",
          "And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.",
          "And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.",
          "And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration.",
          "That's been missing over the last eight years.",
          "And I suspect one of us will have a pick at the end of next year -- the next four years.",
          "We can no longer afford to be second best.",
          "But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.",
          "That's exactly the philosophy that we've seen in place for the last decade.",
          "Well, I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years.",
          "You know, remember the question, are you better off?",
          "It has doubled over the last eight years.",
          "Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration.",
          "We've been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years.",
          "I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.",
          "Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?",
          "I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.",
          "We're being challenged like never before.",
          "For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.",
          "I think we've seen a deterioration of values.",
          "The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today?",
          "Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...",
          "And that's been lacking in the last eight years.",
          "We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.",
          "I've been waiting for years.",
          "It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.",
          "He wanted that said -- 4 years.",
          "Why haven't they done it in seven years?",
          "And this was August, a year ago.",
          "And we're going lower, in my opinion.",
          "Got a Republican Congress cutting spending finally and he said it's the best four years ever.",
          "Yours is phased in in eight years.",
          "We've got a bumper crop this year.",
          "I'm not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.",
          "I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade.",
          "I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.",
          "I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so.",
          "And that's because we've become weaker in each of those four...",
          "We've seen progress over the past several years.",
          "Remember the first two or three months.",
          "We are better off than we were four years ago.",
          "It's been there for 20 years.",
          "Look, we're gonna face some serious new challenges in the next four years.",
          "Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?",
          "You'll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that.",
          "All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.",
          "We are better off than we were four years ago.",
          "Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.",
          "That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.",
          "And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters.",
          "In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.",
          "A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened.",
          "This was last August, a year ago.",
          "I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.",
          "It takes eight years, ten years, to do that.",
          "And for the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council.",
          "I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.",
          "I regret what's happened in these past months.",
          "The president has been AWOL for four years.",
          "Well, let's look at the president's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out.",
          "You talk about eight years?",
          "Because under the last four years, they've been buried.",
          "It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.",
          "And that's why I'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead.",
          "I think that's about a realistic timeframe.",
          "You've been doing this for 30 years.",
          "I'm not talking about leaving.",
          "In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things.",
          "Look, we're in an information age.",
          "I asked: \"Are you better off than you were 4 years before?''",
          "I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.",
          "We have lost over 4,000 lives.",
          "I've said that years ago.",
          "Because they could go back worse than things used to be.",
          "Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?",
          "And what's happened in the meantime?",
          "Well, we've gone through a tough four years.",
          "It's something I've worked on for 15 years.",
          "Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.",
          "And we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome.",
          "And I know talks have started again today.",
          "And what's happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America's young people.",
          "We are going to be thriving again.",
          "Now, what happened in July we've covered again and again and again.",
          "And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years.",
          "And we've gotten some real progress in the last four years.",
          "We've been discouraged too long.",
          "Let's take all these four years in a row.",
          "It's not going to be like the last four years.",
          "The question before you comes down to this: Do you want to see America return to the policies of weakness of the last 4 years?",
          "We were there for the better part of a year.",
          "And now they had ingenuity eight years ago.",
          "And they all say, \"Well, it was a long time ago.\"",
          "But that was 10 years before you took office.",
          "Over the next four years, we'll continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country's neighborhoods.",
          "You did it in 1985.",
          "More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.",
          "I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?",
          "We've been for that for four, five, six years.",
          "I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate.",
          "I'm a year ahead of schedule.",
          "Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.",
          "I've been saying that for over a year now.",
          "I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going.",
          "Again we turn to the past.",
          "And incidentally, an excellent -- I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it.",
          "Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is gonna look like the next four years.",
          "And that's what we've done over the last four years.",
          "Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years.",
          "And at the beginning of the year I had about 2 percent.",
          "They should have been doing this for years.",
          "You've been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine.",
          "That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.",
          "But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there.",
          "Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before.",
          "We've been drifting too long.",
          "They're stronger now than at any time since 2001.",
          "So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.",
          "So in other words, it's pretty divided during the 1990s as well.",
          "And I will continue working with him over the next four years.",
          "For 200 years, we've lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday.",
          "I don't know -- starting after 4 years.",
          "But look, this has been going on for a year.",
          "And actually, you said it back in 2010.",
          "Compared to four years ago, we're clearly better off.",
          "In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix.",
          "That's more than it's had a lot of the time in the last years.",
          "No, they haven't had talks in two years.",
          "I felt that -- I wish we'd have had a better vision of the future.",
          "We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.",
          "Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish.",
          "It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago.",
          "I would be willing to have another debate this year.",
          "They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.",
          "Now, on arms control, we're completing 4 years.",
          "Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.",
          "We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years.",
          "They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months.",
          "You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years.",
          "We've made some progress during the last eight years.",
          "He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.",
          "And I may be better off four years from now, but I don't know.",
          "That's total over the last four years.",
          "We've been cleaning it up for four years.",
          "You've been president four years.",
          "And we've been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years.",
          "And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing.",
          "We've been around for 240 years.",
          "I uh - said that I've served this country for fourteen years.",
          "Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time.",
          "But why didn't you do it over the last 25 years?",
          "Over the last four years we've made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.",
          "Now we've been hurt in recent years in this country.",
          "Yes, we're having tough times, but we do not need to go back to the failed policies of the past, when you had a Democratic president and a spendthrift Democratic Congress.",
          "That's what we've been going through for the last eight years.",
          "And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.",
          "And I ask for your support for 4 more years to finish this job.",
          "People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.",
          "I've been speaking out since day 1.",
          "Well, tonight we've had a chance to talk a lot about the past.",
          "We're going to say you have a five-year limit.",
          "So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago.",
          "And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.",
          "Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.",
          "If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that.",
          "I've been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh - government is comparable.",
          "Look, he has now said repeatedly, \"30 years this and 30 years that.\""

          "This is a time -- this should have been a time for American leadership.",

          "101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do.",
          "And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things.",
          "That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.",
          "And now we see beheadings.",

          "And the significance of prestige, really, is because we're so identified with the cause of freedom.",

          "No, and they don't have to, providing we have the leadership that we put -- that I'm offering.",
          "I'd like to be that leader with your support.",
          "But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is.",

          "Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.",
          "But it takes presidential leadership.",
          "It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.",

          "And that's not how a commander in chief acts.",
          "How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what we've done, in that way?",
          "I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.",
          "And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.",
          "And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.",
          "I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.",
          "I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world.",
          "Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.",
          "I know what strong political leadership is.",
          "90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent.",
          "I think what it means to build consensus.",
          "Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.",
          "We've uh - got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future.",
          "I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.",
          "And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.",
          "We have to provide leadership.",
          "Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?",
          "I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific.",
          "General Petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility, where he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used.",
          "I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you'll see that we need new leadership.",
          "I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation, so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve.",
          "Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States.",
          "He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings.",
          "In the last two years, I have made policy decisions involving - long-range difficulties and policies and made day-to-day judgments not only as president of the United States but as the leader of the free world What is the result of that leadership?",
          "We have good executive orders, and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh - uh - NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision.",
          "We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.",
          "The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?",
          "The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.",
          "But I also know how to lead those alliances.",
          "We are playing the leadership role.",
          "And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes.",
          "And it's very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we're not doing what we need to do...",
          "They're watching what we do, what we say, what we promise and what we finally deliver.",
          "And we can do better than the past administration has done.",
          "And that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.",
          "I also need -- the next leader needs to be patient.",
          "I think our Cabinet members are key people.",
          "They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?",
          "So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.",
          "And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people.",
          "You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength -- and all at the same time.",
          "We have an opportunity to have real leadership.",
          "What we need is good, strong leadership going in the next century.",
          "Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world.",
          "That's where the problem is and I hope there'll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.",
          "But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention, as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world - in those respects, we're not strong.",
          "That's why they call the President the Commander in Chief.",
          "That's the kind of leadership we've shown in the region.",
          "These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.",
          "Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?Ã¢â€°Â¤ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support.",
          "What I have proposed for a long time, and I've had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let's be clear and let's have some straight talk.",
          "We lead the world when we lead by example, not by our power.",
          "It's time for America to find new leadership.",
          "But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.",
          "I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels we've come up with are just about right.",
          "What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.",
          "That's what leadership is all about.",
          "And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who's shown the ability to get things done?",
          "And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.",
          "We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties.",
          "But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.",
          "Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?",
          "And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat.",
          "And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.",
          "And the exit strategy needs to be well-defined.",
          "Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there.",
          "That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.",
          "It's a nation that's not like -- like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.",
          "That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.",
          "But I am familiar with the statement, and it was made by one of the top-ranking officials of that organization.",
          "But more than that, they are role models.",
          "Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead.",
          "One of the more important things we're doing in this administration is transformation.",
          "And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership.",
          "As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear.",
          "But we have no leadership.",
          "If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves.",
          "And so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.",
          "Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not.",
          "It needs to be competent.",
          "This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.",
          "In order to lead, you first have to use the White House as a bully pulpit and lead; then you have to develop consensus or you can't get anything done, and that's where we are now.",
          "Now that means the best leadership.",
          "This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.",
          "And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.",
          "But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.",
          "That's what a leader does.",
          "But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.",
          "But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.",
          "I'm ready to provide that leadership.",
          "Come on, that's not leadership.",
          "And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.",
          "This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project.",
          "You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the -- of three branches there.",
          "It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.",
          "I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.",
          "One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation.",
          "It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership.",
          "But the point is it's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence.",
          "He is the leader of that country.",

          "You also have investments in Chinese companies.",
          "And so we can be a partner with China.",

          "We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.",
          "And production on private -- on government land --",
          "What happens in those forests, because of lousy federal policy, is they grow to be -- they are not -- they're not harvested.",
          "I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy.",
          "It's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then.",
          "I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation.",
          "Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.",
          "I have -- was fought for a very strong title in the farm bill for the conservation reserve program to set aside millions of acres of land to help improve wildlife and the habitat.",
          "You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate.",
          "If you could accept a little criticism, I went all across central Illinois and spoke about agricultural issues, about seven stops.",
          "I would like our farmers feeding the world.",
          "I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.",
          "He favors this supply maintenance or production controls.",
          "And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.",
          "I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was --",
          "So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?",
          "The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.",
          "On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program.",
          "Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.",
          "And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side.",
          "And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment.",
          "That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities.",
          "But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.",
          "Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent.",
          "And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.",
          "Exports are down, and every time an export number goes down, it hurts the farmer.",
          "So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.",
          "But let's not go back and keep assailing a farm bill that passed with overwhelming Democrat and Republican support.",
          "Now, I'll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs.",
          "All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.",
          "The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.",
          "The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas.",
          "We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.",
          "As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.",
          "Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up.",
          "We ought to have rural enterprise zones.",
          "I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.",
          "I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won't have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent.",
          "It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.",
          "Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products.",
          "I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture.",
          "The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.",
          "I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country.",
          "I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time.",
          "The grain sales have been a benefit to American agriculture.",
          "Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.",
          "Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year.",
          "On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley.",
          "And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better.",
          "They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time.",
          "It penalizes the family farmer.",
          "And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.",
          "And not one thing did I see, with respect, on your network about my views on agriculture, and not one did I read in any newspaper.",
          "Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?",
          "Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.",
          "We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.",
          "The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.",
          "The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.",
          "We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products.",
          "I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy.",
          "George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill.",
          "Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.",
          "So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote, I also understand -- I want to open up markets, but I also understand that farming is a part of our national security.",
          "And so, this is a reasonable policy to protect old stands of trees and at the same time make sure our forests aren't vulnerable to the forest fires that have destroyed acres after acres in the West.",
          "Number three, stop the federal government's program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won't do the same thing for plants that stay here.",
          "The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 211/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.",
          "And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.",
          "Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies.",
          "We're the best producers in the world, and I want -- I want the farmers feeding the world.",
          "We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did.",
          "Will he join me in suggesting that we may need another plant?",
          "Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.",
          "I'm for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side.",
          "He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.",
          "And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you're specifically including conservation and protection of the environment.",
          "And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.",
          "The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.",
          "They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.",
          "You take the raw product you produce, I presume you're a farmer, off your farm, and you convert it.",
          "And it won't help us grow.",
          "One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax.",
          "I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.",
          "WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the best and the most efficient farmers.",
          "The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.",
          "And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.",
          "In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure.",
          "Particularly some of the smaller producers.",
          "I oppose supply management and production controls.",
          "Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work.",
          "And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.",
          "Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.",
          "And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time.",
          "He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours.",
          "It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.",
          "But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.",
          "Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that.",
          "We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture.",
          "In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.",
          "The farm income in America is high.",
          "We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production.",
          "Now, many here who are not involved in farming don't -- won't follow this, so just forgive me.",
          "Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldn't eat except for them.",
          "They don't want to see the world break out into -- into various forms of chaos, because they have to -- they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs.",
          "And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists.",
          "We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.",
          "But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.",
          "A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.",
          "And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them -- enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest.",
          "I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.",
          "I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.",
          "I think that this farm policy has failed.",
          "They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.",
          "I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy.",
          "He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today."

          "It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea.",
          "And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons.",
          "I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.",
          "It would depend entirely on what they asked us to do, but the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements they've made and find a way to trust each other, and they're going to have to spend some time and trust each other.",
          "On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.",
          "But one of the things we've learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it's in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes.",
          "That's why in my speech to the Congress I said: There's an \"Axis of Evil,\" Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and we're paying attention to it.",
          "And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.",
          "That's one of the problems with this administration's so-called shuttle diplomacy.",
          "And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China.",
          "What I worry about with the president is that he's not acknowledging what's on the ground, he's not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he's not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem-cell research or of global warming and other issues.",
          "Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he'd go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement.",
          "I applaud the no-fly zone, and I know that he's going back to the United Nations to try to get authority to enforce it.",
          "And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.",
          "And for two years, this administration didn't talk at all to North Korea.",
          "With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.",
          "But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.",
          "And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.",
          "In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.",

          "Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.",
          "And while he's been diverted, with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army, either going to Iraq, coming back from Iraq, or getting ready to go, North Korea's gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.",
          "We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.",
          "And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.",
          "He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans.",
          "Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.",
          "I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.",
          "When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.",
          "Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.",
          "And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy.",
          "And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.",
          "Japan will be hosting a summit.",
          "But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has.",

          "I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin.",

          "We don't need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent.",
          "And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary.",
          "There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.",
          "If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.",
          "I'm sorry we didn't have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, \"Well, we really didn't know much the first couple of years about foreign policy.\"",
          "We've got agreements, but they are still there.",
          "And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doing injustice to America, he'd be doing injustice to China, as well.",
          "Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy.",
          "I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek - and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments.",
          "And by that I mean we're moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons.",
          "Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.",

          "We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.",
          "And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.",
          "One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War.",
          "All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.",
          "We must have China's leverage on Kim Jong Il, besides ourselves.",
          "He says, Ã¢â€°Â¥Well, let's concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega.",
          "And when we haven't done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks.",
          "More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.",
          "If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty.",
          "We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them.",

          "We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea.",
          "That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.",
          "It's precisely what Kim Jong Il wants.",
          "We've sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea.",
          "We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.",
          "Donald wants to tear up our alliances.",
          "As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia.",
          "Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans.",
          "But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is.",
          "As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea.",
          "Third, we've got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads.",
          "When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, \"No, no, we'll go do this alone.\"",
          "And we uh - had the emperor of Japan here this uh - past year and the net result is Japan and the United States are working more closely together now than at any time in the history of our relationship.",
          "It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.",
          "Now the United States, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the uh - People's Republic of China sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula.",
          "You know my opinion on North Korea.",
          "We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again.",
          "Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.",
          "I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.",
          "That's all behind us now, and it should be behind us, and the forgotten war, the Korean War, but I guess I can just answer you very plainly, Jason.",
          "And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way.",
          "That's exactly what Kim Jong Il wants.",
          "He now wants to take the six-party talks we have -- China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States -- and undermine them by having bilateral talks.",
          "We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.",
          "What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea.",
          "First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections.",
          "Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.",
          "For two years, the president didn't even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor.",
          "And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans.",
          "He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",
          "China should go into North Korea.",
          "Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.",
          "So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one.",
          "I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh - the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh - South Korea in an area of defense.",
          "In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.",
          "A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.",
          "Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.",
          "Here we have our own secretary of state who has had to apologize to the world for the presentation he made to the United Nations.",
          "You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.",
          "I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability.",
          "China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.",
          "Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.",
          "In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.",
          "Let me talk about North Korea.",
          "I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.",
          "North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability.",
          "This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.",
          "Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.",
          "By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth.",
          "We can't have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country.",
          "He didn't honor the agreement.",
          "One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked.",
          "They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.",
          "South Korea faces a very delicate situation.",
          "It's not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il.",
          "And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.",
          "The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.",
          "I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.",
          "In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area.",
          "They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards.",
          "It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.",
          "... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",
          "On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get -- the Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.",
          "The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.",
          "When President Bush decided we're not going to talk to Iran, we're not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened?",
          "North Korea, first, I do."

          "We're just in a period -- we've got to work to bring it -- my opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and I'm glad he did.",
          "And it fits with his philosophy.",
          "Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues.",
          "And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy.",

          "He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers \"people who aren't captured.\"",

          "And that's one of the reasons I've said before, and I'll pledge here tonight, if I'm president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill.",
          "In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks.",
          "And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.",
          "Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks.",
          "And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.",
          "I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.",
          "And then she said, \"But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain.\"",
          "Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what?",
          "And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, \"I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,\" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't.",

          "Senator McCain continues to repeat this.",
          "Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, jointly, for a commission that closes corporate giveaway loopholes.",
          "Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses.",
          "I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.",
          "Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.",
          "No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.",
          "Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq.",
          "And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill.",
          "And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.",
          "Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand.",
          "Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.",
          "Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.",
          "I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks.",
          "And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.",

          "Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.",
          "Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.",
          "Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.",
          "Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.",
          "When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.",
          "And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.",
          "And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.",
          "And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.",
          "And one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America.",
          "And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.",
          "In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.",
          "I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.",
          "Now, what we haven't talked about is Senator McCain's plan.",
          "John McCain is for me for president because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq.",
          "Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot.",
          "My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq.",
          "What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them.",
          "But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.",
          "Bob, I think it's going to be important to just -- I'll respond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention.",
          "Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.",
          "And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.",
          "And, absolutely, we need earmark reform.",
          "Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill.",
          "Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for moderating.",
          "Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.",
          "Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth.",
          "That's going to change when I'm president, but we can't change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy.",
          "And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.",
          "And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.",
          "Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.",
          "Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.",
          "Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach.",
          "And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, \"Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it.\"",
          "Senator McCain and I actually agree on something.",
          "Senator McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices.",
          "Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.",
          "That was Senator McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.",
          "And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and it's not a new position for me.",
          "Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.",
          "Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable."

          "You see it in the church burnings.",
          "And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.",
          "I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead.",
          "I was taught -- I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself.",
          "This nation is the most religious nation on Earth -- more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth -- and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.",

          "We have to stop them from leaving.",
          "I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.",
          "But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.",
          "I also think that we should give visas to people -- green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need.",
          "You have to close the borders.",
          "Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders.",
          "What I was saying is, we're not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation.",
          "They're foreign lobbyists taking leaves.",
          "In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here...",
          "And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American.",
          "Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation of immigrants.",
          "There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen.",
          "George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.",
          "Less regulations if we want jobs here; legal reform if we want jobs here; and we've got to keep taxes low.",
          "What I will do is I'll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.",
          "It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.",
          "We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.",
          "So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.",
          "But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.",
          "We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.",
          "You know, my friends, my parents came to this country as immigrants like millions and millions of Americans before them and since, seeking opportunities, seeking the American dream.",
          "The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will.",
          "He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that.",
          "Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.",
          "Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked.",
          "He says we have to move from one area of the world to another.",
          "Those who've come here illegally take their place.",
          "Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.",
          "We have more people who qualify.",
          "And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.",
          "I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status.",
          "The last thing I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country, in Washington with more police on the street, in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in Southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.",
          "I mean that's what, I want to stop it from coming across the border.",
          "People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.",
          "Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.",
          "How -- why would these people stay there?",
          "But this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heaven's sakes.",
          "But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.",
          "We have to have strong borders.",
          "As a matter of fact - now- I don't advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon.",
          "And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.",
          "And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.",
          "The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.",
          "And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.",
          "The fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and I'll make them secure.",
          "But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.",
          "Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.",
          "And, as the next president of the United States, I will make that border wall complete.",
          "We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.",
          "He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.",
          "Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons.",
          "We're going to have a strong border.",
          "We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.",
          "I thought we were talking about immigration.",
          "But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.",
          "Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal.",
          "You're running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration.",
          "We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.",
          "Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise.",
          "We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.",
          "And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.",
          "We will bring our cities back.",
          "But it is true our borders are out of control.",
          "He didn't call for self-deportation.",
          "And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.",
          "Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants.",
          "And in my administration, we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border.",
          "I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.",
          "And the good thing about this is they'll be able to go across America.",
          "Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right.",
          "Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.",
          "I'm going to find people that want to serve their country.",
          "And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.",
          "So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.",
          "Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country.",
          "The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.",
          "We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows we strengthened control of the border.",
          "I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.",
          "Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes?",
          "We will not have open borders.",
          "Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today.",
          "I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are.",
          "And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.",
          "I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.",
          "I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.",
          "I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.",
          "But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration.",
          "I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.",
          "And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.",
          "Didn't close off the borders.",
          "They're going to many other countries.",
          "If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border.",
          "They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.",
          "We didn't guard the borders.",
          "Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty.",
          "I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.",
          "We either have a border or we don't.",
          "Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.",
          "It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations.",
          "We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.",
          "Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11.",
          "Number two, we're going to have to stop illegal immigration.",
          "If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.",
          "As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.",
          "My parents came to this country as immigrants.",
          "With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status.",
          "So just to finish on the borders...",
          "We have no country if we have no border.",
          "What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families.",
          "So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.",
          "You know, it's so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home.",
          "And we'll continue to protect our borders.",
          "And we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel.",
          "Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.",
          "But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.",
          "I don't want to go down the path to Spain.",
          "And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.",
          "When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.",
          "I mean we're just a few miles away from Ellis Island.",
          "Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border.",
          "Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.",
          "And nothing has been done, and they are now charging to take tourists there to see this terrible desolation.",
          "So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.",
          "And they want this country to go in a new direction.",
          "They will want to do what's good for our country.",
          "We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.",
          "But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions.",
          "You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.",
          "Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico.",
          "We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border.",
          "And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.",
          "We welcome legal immigrants into this country.",
          "They feel we have to have strong borders.",
          "I don't think you have to -- shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally.",
          "I don't have any foreign lobbyists on leave in my campaign.",
          "And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.",
          "Our airports are like from a third world country.",
          "I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico.",
          "And may God continue to bless our great land.",
          "And the fact is, I've made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people.",
          "And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.",
          "So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.",
          "He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.",
          "We're increasing the border security of the United States.",
          "That's why we have the great migration.",
          "I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.",
          "It will come from the pockets of the people.",
          "... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.",
          "The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.",
          "But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.",
          "We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.",
          "We're way behind, which means Americans can't come home."

          "And we'll continue to spend money on research and development, because I truly believe that's the way to get from how we live today to being able to live a standard of living that we're accustomed to and being able to protect our environment better, the use of technologies.",
          "And domestic sources that are cleaner and better.",

          "We're headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration.",
          "If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.",
          "And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.",

          "It all sounds to me like you're going to have some government setting price.",
          "I don't have a one of them, and I haven't taken a penny of foreign money, and I never will.",
          "So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.",
          "And you have to have cost controls, yes.",

          "My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.",
          "I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.",
          "And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour; then it's leveled again, but in the meantime you've wrecked the country with these kind of deals.",

          "Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.",

          "The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.",
          "But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 211/2 -- the prime rate.",

          "We don't have inflation because the people are living too well.",
          "I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.",
          "The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.",
          "Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.",
          "And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.",
          "I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.",
          "And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending.",
          "And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.",
          "Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low.",

          "Our dollar's at an all time low against some foreign currencies.",
          "We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below.",
          "The interest rates are based on inflation.",
          "Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%.",
          "I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.",
          "Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy.",
          "We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.",
          "These interest rates we have now don't make any sense.",
          "That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.",
          "Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.",
          "So what we've got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line.",
          "They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15.",
          "It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less.",
          "With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.",
          "He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.",
          "When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said.",
          "In Puerto Rico this year, I met with six of the leading industrial nations' heads of state to meet the problem of inflation so we would be able to solve it before it got out of hand.",
          "Now in addition, we had a very - some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation.",
          "We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.",
          "The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.",
          "And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation.",
          "Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.",
          "We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.",
          "That's saying we're cutting the rates.",
          "Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.",
          "And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.",
          "The dollar's gone through the floor.",
          "We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation.",
          "In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.",
          "We have considered inflation in our figures.",
          "But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.",
          "We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.",
          "Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.",
          "The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.",
          "Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.",
          "But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh - of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh - 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about - uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget.",
          "There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 211/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.",
          "And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.",
          "We have cut inflation by better than half.",
          "And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.",
          "In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy.",
          "And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending.",
          "And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since I've been president because we have pushed them hard.",
          "Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.",
          "I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.",
          "We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh - calendar year this year - something slightly under 6 percent.",
          "But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.",
          "The worst inflation since the Great Depression.",
          "Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.",
          "We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.",
          "I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.",
          "As a matter of fact, the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated -- over exaggerated.",
          "We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.",
          "Let me say, if Senator Dole mentioned this, I just signed a bill that we got through Congress to increase the amount of pay increase we could give for military personnel and to make sure the pay increase this year was above the rate of inflation.",
          "His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.",
          "Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.",
          "Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.",
          "Today it is up a plus 4 percent.",
          "But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?",
          "And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.",
          "So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation.",
          "I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation.",
          "Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation.",
          "And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.",
          "Inflation is robbing us, as we've already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh - just a horrible mess.",
          "And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare.",
          "The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.",
          "They assumed that the uh - inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh - therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh - tried to increase the uh - the tax uh - payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations.",
          "We have inflation because the Government is living too well.",
          "You've said publicly that it's now three times the rate of inflation.",
          "When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.",
          "But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.",
          "If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about.",
          "Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.",
          "In addition, we've brought down inflation.",
          "Did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough.",
          "And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs.",
          "And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?",
          "So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.",
          "But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.",
          "Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people."

          "Well, is a homebuyer better off he can refinance the home, because interest rates are down?",
          "I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less.",
          "Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.",
          "We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.",
          "And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers.",
          "And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low."

          "The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.",
          "I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.",
          "I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.",
          "But he has made -- not admitted a mistake and I just find it impossible to understand how an American can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land -- organizing demonstrations against it when young men are held prisoner in Hanoi or kids out of the ghetto were drafted.",
          "Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president.",
          "You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.",
          "Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh - Watergate and uh - the CIA revelations, people have feel - have felt that they've uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh - heat of the campaign - I've been in thirty primaries during the springtime, I've been campaigning for twenty-two months - I've made some mistakes.",
          "In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly.",
          "I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle.",
          "I remember what the administration tried to do in 1993.",
          "The administration did not deal with it.",
          "And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when -- when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake.",
          "When Harry Truman was president he was not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense.",
          "And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.",
          "I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.",
          "He fails to point out that uh - in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam.",
          "Yes, and I'm certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh - bad period of time in American political history.",
          "Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill.",
          "And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we're doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon's view.",
          "And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.",
          "Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said 'It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.'",
          "We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.",
          "And that's the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it.",
          "Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.",
          "Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh - is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record.",
          "I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors - both Democrats and Republicans - have advocated resolving those troubles in those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation.",
          "And I don't think it's uh - the Congress is Mr. Ford's opponent; but if uh - if - if he insists that uh - that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I'm - have not been a part, then I think it's only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part.",
          "Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration.",
          "Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.",
          "Perhaps Mrs. Truman can, but I don't think I can.",
          "Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration.",
          "Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh - propaganda that I've read.",
          "Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States.",
          "And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department.",
          "If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.",
          "The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.",
          "When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.",
          "And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.",
          "In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.",
          "This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.",
          "I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.",
          "But I would cite that as a major accomplishment.",
          "Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the - the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition.",
          "The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there.",
          "Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.",
          "It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.",
          "I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.",
          "Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.",
          "And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.",
          "Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them.",
          "I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.",
          "As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination.",
          "Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.",
          "Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.",
          "I was chairman of \"Minnesotans for Kennedy;'' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called \"Democrats for Nixon.''",
          "Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense.",
          "I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.",
          "You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.",
          "And he has made the point that you have not repudiated some of the semidiplomatic activity of the Reverend Jackson, particularly in Central America.",
          "It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...",
          "Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected.",
          "The Reagan-Bush administration was right.",
          "I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.",
          "Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.",
          "Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well.",
          "And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.",
          "Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports.",
          "Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, \"American boys into Indochina.\"",
          "This country uh - changed drastically in 1969 when the uh - terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and - and Gerald Ford became the presidents.",
          "And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.",
          "The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power.",
          "It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today.",
          "And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.",
          "But I don't believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing - has identified itself with that change.",
          "He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.",
          "And Colin Powell helped set up that summit.",
          "The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.",
          "He was criticizing President Reagan.",
          "I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.",
          "(Laughter) You don't want us to mention appointees, but when you see the quality of people in our administration, see how Colin Powell performed -- I say administration --",
          "I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.",
          "We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.",
          "The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission.",
          "I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.",
          "Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.",
          "And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.",
          "Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the uh - problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam.",
          "Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state.",
          "The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.",
          "But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong.",
          "I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.",
          "I question - and I don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam.",
          "They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.",
          "Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?",
          "Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy, you were wrong to attack my patriotism.",
          "This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years.",
          "He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.",
          "Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter.",
          "They were presidents at historic times.",
          "In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed.",
          "The Administration tried to do it repeatedly, repeatedly in 81 82.",
          "I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his -- his action there.",
          "I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away.",
          "His some of his college presidents aren't exactly holier than thou.",
          "The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.",
          "I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals of historical perspective of his own party.",
          "Since the assassination of our best leaders in the '60's, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform.",
          "Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.",
          "And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.",
          "We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board.",
          "Ronald Reagan was the last president...",
          "On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon.",
          "I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did.",
          "It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.",
          "Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford.",
          "Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low?",
          "I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input.",
          "Just to uh - correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine.",
          "I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still.",
          "The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something, because he never did it without the threat of force.",
          "That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.",
          "I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.",
          "I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.",
          "And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.",
          "And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.",
          "Wasn't this the George Bush that supported Mr. Meese?",
          "This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.",
          "So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.",
          "Well, first let me say with respect to the freeze, that back in the spring of 1982 Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today.",
          "And Colin Powell so stated.",
          "He said it was in the public interest at the time and most everybody who was involved in it, I guess, thought it was.",
          "Now the present Administration - the President - has said - never indicated what he thought of the 1954 decision.",
          "But I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner.",
          "I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.",
          "I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again.",
          "In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.",
          "But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was.",
          "I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.",
          "One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace."

          "You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.",
          "No, what I said was that, because we achieved such a rapid victory, more of the Saddam loyalists were around.",
          "He had the capability of making weapons, and he would have made weapons.",
          "Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell.",
          "But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was.",
          "I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked.",
          "He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.",
          "Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions.",
          "I've had one position, one consistent position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat.",
          "In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.",
          "And in a war, there's a lot of -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldn't have done that.",
          "And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.",
          "I believe the president made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was: build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job and go through the U.N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort.",
          "And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that.",
          "That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.",
          "I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.",
          "The very president who said he was going to end endless war, who pretended to have been against the war in Iraq all along -- although we know that's not true -- now has more troops going to the Middle East.",
          "Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein.",
          "You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.",
          "And he was down there fighting against imperialism.",
          "Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming.",
          "But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.",
          "But 9/11 changed it all.",
          "Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.",
          "He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.",
          "He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom.",
          "Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.",
          "... before the invasion, he supported it.",
          "The world is more dangerous today because the president didn't make the right judgments.",
          "And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.",
          "I was against the war.",
          "Now, let's go back to Saddam Hussein.",
          "And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.",
          "What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something.",
          "He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.",
          "Well, let me tell you straight up: I've never changed my mind about Iraq.",
          "He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U.N., pushed them away individually.",
          "He didn't take that position on Tibet.",
          "But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support.",
          "But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.",
          "But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.",
          "He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.",
          "I would go after Baghdadi.",
          "On the neutralists' resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened.",
          "He's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to.",
          "And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose, is ludicrous, in my judgment.",
          "But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.",
          "He said I misled on Iraq.",
          "His words amount to genocide incitation.",
          "I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.",
          "You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq.",
          "I decided the right action was in Iraq.",
          "The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.",
          "And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better.",
          "And, unfortunately, he didn't go to war as a last resort.",
          "He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.",
          "I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.",
          "The Duelfer report confirmed that decision today, because what Saddam Hussein was doing was trying to get rid of sanctions so he could reconstitute a weapons program.",
          "We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier.",
          "And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.",
          "And the reason he didn't is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.",
          "And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.",
          "Did it make him withdraw from the north?",
          "The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror.",
          "I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict.",
          "We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, you can take the northern part of Kuwait.",
          "I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.",
          "And his answer was, \"With a viable exit strategy and only with enough forces to get the job done.\"",
          "Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was.",
          "I -- I think interesting the president just said something which -- which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.",
          "You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.",
          "But the important -- I'd like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad.",
          "They avoided even the advice of their own general.",
          "And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it.",
          "I don't think he has to be a dictator.",
          "Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there?",
          "I mean, this is the president who said \"There were weapons of mass destruction,\" said \"Mission accomplished,\" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true.",
          "I was opposed to the war.",
          "He did not do so.",
          "Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.",
          "He said Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America.",
          "It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.",
          "And that was the serious, serious threat.",
          "But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat.",
          "I don't think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002.",
          "It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back.",
          "That's why he called him a grave threat.",
          "We told him he could take the northern part of Kuwait, and when he took the whole thing, we went nuts.",
          "But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.",
          "I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.",
          "In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.",
          "And let's give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield.",
          "My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.",
          "So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.",
          "Nor was I misleading on the day that the president decided to go to war when I said that he had made a mistake in not building strong alliances and that I would have preferred that he did more diplomacy.",
          "Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing, but to the ordinary American out there who doesn't know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they're near the border.",
          "He is -- listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids.",
          "The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way.",
          "He is an indicted war criminal.",
          "We had Saddam Hussein trapped.",
          "He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.",
          "My opponent opposed the missile defenses.",
          "On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted.",
          "Saddam Hussein didn't attack us.",
          "Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.",
          "I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush.",
          "You can't change the dynamics on the ground if you've criticized the brave leader of Iraq.",
          "Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?",
          "And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.",
          "He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would've threatened the Middle Eastern world supply.",
          "He caused the death of so many people.",
          "He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president.",
          "And we kicked this man out of Kuwait.",
          "I wasn't misleading when I said he was a threat.",
          "But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.",
          "And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.",
          "Maybe an 18th resolution would work,\" he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off.",
          "And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.",
          "I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.",
          "If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base.",
          "The first time -- and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen -- once, and sometimes twice -- the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember.",
          "And he just lifted martial law.",
          "And I don't hold it against him that he said grave threat.",
          "And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.",
          "But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?",
          "That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.",
          "You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror.",
          "But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions.",
          "Would he have started a war?",
          "I was against the war in Iraq.",
          "Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.",
          "We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, \"Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator.\"",
          "He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.",
          "I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat.",
          "He didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President.",
          "He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible.",
          "But I don't confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told - which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards - it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on.",
          "I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq.",
          "And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.",
          "Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.",
          "And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction.",
          "You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.",
          "There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way.",
          "Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.",
          "You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni.",
          "In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq, he just said, \"The enemy attacked us.\"",
          "There is a difference with what the president did in Kosovo which I supported and this.",
          "I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.",
          "And then the war was very badly mishandled.",
          "I always believed he was a threat.",
          "As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.",
          "His first statement was, \"Both sides ought to show restraint.\"",
          "And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.",
          "And I suggest that in a free society owned by the people, the American people ought to know what we told Ambassador Glaspie to tell Saddam Hussein, because we spent a lot of money and risked lives and lost lives in that effort, and did not accomplish most of our objectives.",
          "And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.",
          "or 15 months ago, on what he believed in.",
          "Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.",
          "And what did he do then?",
          "I'm not going to go around the country saying he didn't tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.",
          "And we never picked him up on that and did what was necessary to transfer authority and to transfer reconstruction.",
          "And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth.",
          "And the world is better off without him in power.",
          "Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, ma'am.",
          "First of all, I don't think he can succeed in Iraq.",
          "And he was a risk that -- and this is where we just have a difference of opinion.",
          "Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; it's in the zone of dangerous.",
          "The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry.",
          "We knew he'd been -- invaded other countries.",
          "Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.",
          "And also General Petraeus said the same thing.",
          "Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country.",
          "Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago.",
          "He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free.",
          "But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on.",
          "But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.",
          "But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq.",
          "When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.",
          "So I think what was wrong -- I give credit where credit is due -- but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous.",
          "Would he have bombed Iran?",
          "The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result.",
          "The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.",
          "He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs.",
          "I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.",
          "We didn't guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction.",
          "We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein.",
          "We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations; he did have the 4th largest army.",
          "Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.",
          "I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.",
          "The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, \"Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor.\"",
          "He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze.",
          "There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye.",
          "But what he has said is that, even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection with Al Qaida, he would still have done everything the same way.",
          "And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace.",
          "And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.",
          "I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.",
          "He needed to be disarmed.",
          "But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared.",
          "I did not support the war in Iraq.",
          "That's one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly--highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator.",
          "Saddam Hussein was a threat because he could have given weapons of mass destruction to terrorist enemies.",
          "Remember, he's the person who's accusing me of not acting multilaterally.",
          "He'd been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq.",
          "Look, you have to build a consensus, but in some things -- Ross mentioned Saddam Hussein.",
          "That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy.",
          "The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction.",
          "This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.",
          "He's said that it's been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat.",
          "Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.",
          "But that doesn't mean it wasn't a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden.",
          "The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, \"And the world would be a lot better off.\"",
          "I don't see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place.",
          "Now, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy -- very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation -- but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq.",
          "You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.",
          "And it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control.",
          "I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular.",
          "The world is safer without Saddam Hussein.",
          "And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence.",
          "I said that I'd end the war in Iraq, and I did.",
          "And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.",
          "The president made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq.",
          "He took his eye off the ball, off of Osama bin Laden.",
          "I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.",
          "And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him.",
          "We knew he tortured his own people.",
          "But in late '89 the president signed a secret policy saying we were going to continue to try to improve relations with him, and we sent him some sort of communication on the eve of his invasion of Kuwait that we still wanted better relations.",
          "I don't think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.",
          "And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.",
          "And the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here in terms of Saddam Hussein.",
          "And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse.",
          "But then when he moved against Kuwait, I said this will not stand.",
          "You know, for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein.",
          "But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about.",
          "We got Kuwait back to the emir but he's still not his nuclear, his chemical, his bacteriological and he's still over there, right?",
          "He and I used to have arguments about the war.",
          "I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.",
          "There's just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power.",
          "And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom.",
          "We had to stand up against a tyrant.",
          "He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger.",
          "The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office.",
          "He voted against the first Gulf War.",
          "And that was before the war started.",
          "Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.",
          "I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.",
          "We tried this with Hitler.",
          "And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.",
          "So he would have been alive today.",
          "I don't think he misled you when he said that, you know, anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didn't have the judgment to be president.",
          "Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling.",
          "I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.",
          "It would have been increase in sectarian violence.",
          "He misled the American people when he said we'd go to war as a last resort.",
          "He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort.",
          "Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden -- than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden?",
          "Yet at the same time, he was very -- we were very unpopular in Europe because of the decisions he made.",
          "Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA.",
          "That was the reason Congress gave him the authority to use force, not after excuse to get rid of the regime.",
          "The general who was with him said All he ever wants to do is divide people not unite people at all.",
          "Clearly nobody's going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages.",
          "He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq.",
          "We knew he hated us.",
          "Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.",
          "And what's interesting is, it's a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasn't a threat.",
          "The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.",
          "If you create Saddam Hussein, over a 10-year period, using billions of dollars of US taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.",
          "Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.",
          "In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries.",
          "I talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding Saddam Hussein accountable.",
          "He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.",
          "And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead.",
          "This is the history of dealing with dictators.",
          "And a year later, 9/11 happened.",
          "And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.",
          "In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.",
          "The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.",
          "Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power.",
          "In addition to that, what did he do?"

          "But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.",
          "The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China.",
          "I support it and the Pescadores Island.",
          "General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: \"To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take.",
          "The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.",
          "Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa.",
          "In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take.",
          "Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.",
          "I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.",
          "I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.",
          "Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.",
          "But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.",
          "Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say \"I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;\" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us.",
          "Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.",
          "Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.",
          "Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended.",
          "I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.",
          "Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.",
          "The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island.",
          "What we're now talking about is the Vice President's determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area.",
          "Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible.",
          "I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested - to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance - is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war.",
          "We retained control as though we had sovereignty.",
          "First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.",
          "Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores.",
          "And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.",
          "What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.",
          "I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.",
          "And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this - change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors - the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors - to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable.",
          "Perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside.",
          "For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.",
          "And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.",
          "We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.",
          "I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island.",
          "These two islands are in the area of freedom.",
          "When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.",
          "Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - \"neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu.\"",
          "I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.",
          "I believe that we should defend Formosa.",
          "He's indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom.",
          "I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war.",
          "Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East.",
          "I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.",
          "There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa.",
          "So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.",
          "And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.",
          "I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.",
          "In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: \"The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area.\"",
          "These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.",
          "Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu.",
          "It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.",
          "They don't want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don't want just Formosa; they want the world.",
          "And therefore, the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa.",
          "He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.",
          "I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy.",
          "Because he will not withdraw, because he's committed to these islands, because we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position.",
          "I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.",
          "If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're a- they're after Formosa.",
          "We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.",
          "Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan.",
          "The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.",
          "Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest I have.",
          "The Nationalists have these two islands.",
          "Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.",
          "But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.",
          "And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.",
          "Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.",
          "And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.",
          "Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.",
          "Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.",
          "But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.",
          "I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line.",
          "The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.",
          "The treaty does not include these two islands."

          "Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.",
          "That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.",
          "I thought it was a good program.",
          "So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.",
          "Even the administration has admitted they haven't done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.",
          "Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time.",
          "It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.",
          "So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.",
          "And my program is this.",
          "We've got to innovate through this America 2000 program.",
          "But it is a good program.",
          "We're talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20,000 new bureaucrats.",
          "Let's talk about the programs.",
          "Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.",
          "Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?",
          "We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.",
          "I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.",
          "We need to have more second chance programs.",
          "So these are three programs which are quite moderate.",
          "What we do need to do, though, is control the growth of these mandatory programs.",
          "He offers retreads of programs that failed.",
          "And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.",
          "What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound.",
          "We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.",
          "There are some programs that are underfunded.",
          "That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program.",
          "But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies.",
          "The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community.",
          "We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work.",
          "I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance.",
          "We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them.",
          "I've even scaled back some of my favorite programs already, like the child-care program I wanted to fund and the national service program, because the president's deficit keeps growing and I've said as a pledge, \"I'm going to cut the deficit in half in four years.\"",
          "It is a plan that will have 200 new programs -- expanded programs and creates 20,000 new bureaucrats.",
          "It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years.",
          "One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.",
          "I know how to eliminate programs.",
          "I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else.",
          "You take a look at all the programs you've advocated, Mr. President.",
          "The reason I have opposed that initiative is because I'm afraid it will end those extra effort programs.",
          "There are some programs that are very important that are under funded.",
          "And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.",
          "I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.",
          "Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?",
          "We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.",
          "One party is ready to move in these programs.",
          "This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable.",
          "Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.",
          "And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then I'll phase in the programs that we've uh - advocated, more slowly.",
          "Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described.",
          "He endorses the Democratic uh - platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs.",
          "Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.",
          "The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to -- I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea.",
          "I also had a program starting last year.",
          "He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.",
          "I don't think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs.",
          "I think Mr. Benson's program has failed.",
          "The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect."

          "This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.",
          "Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments.",
          "But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.",
          "The only thing I believe is that whatever the - the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh - incident occurred.",

          "Well, Mr. Ford, unfortunately, has just made a statement that's not true.",
          "And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.",
          "He was furious because he told me that it was the action of me, President Ford, that saved the lives of the crew of the Mayaguez.",

          "As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \"Lincoln.\"",
          "Ah - I'm not uh - sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had - had expressed uh - his concern about the statement or apologized for it.",
          "So far, Mr. Ford has not responded.",

          "Well, Mr. Ford takes the uh - same attitude that the Republicans always take.",
          "You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.",
          "I was talking about Mr. Ford.",
          "And I think it's very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state.",
          "One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.",
          "Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.",
          "Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford.",
          "We need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president, the leader of his country, to seek out every possible way to get that information which has kept the MIA families in despair and doubt, and Mr. Ford has just not done it.",
          "I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.",
          "Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.",
          "I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh - Voting Rights Acts and the uh - Civil Rights Acts in their uh - debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it.",
          "In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures.",
          "These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.",

          "I - I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford's position on gun control has changed.",
          "Uh - earlier, uh - Mr. Levi, his uh - attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh - so-called Saturday Night Specials.",
          "First of all, I would quit conducting the decision-making process in secret, as has been a characteristic of Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Ford.",

          "Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.",
          "As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget.",
          "He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, \"We will plan carefully.",
          "You know, I saw a movie - \"Crocodile Dundee.\"",
          "Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress.",
          "When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s.",
          "Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement.",
          "When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars.",
          "I notice that Mr. Ford didn't comment on the uh - prisons in Chile.",
          "I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.",
          "And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.",
          "This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward.",
          "I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, \"Ford to New York: Drop Dead.\"",
          "I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford.",
          "But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.",
          "Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country.",
          "The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan.",
          "This is the kind of record that's there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn't go.",

          "No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I've just outlined.",

          "So what, what is in my plan and I think it's almost identical in Senator Dole's plans is we make more people eligible to save in an IRA and let couples, married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to, for medical emergencies or buy a home or education, but they could also save to supplement retirement.",
          "Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U.N. Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U.N.",
          "They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.",
          "And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.",
          "My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his word.",
          "But you know, Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, he's had roughly the same amount of experience.",
          "And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees.",
          "But I hope tonight you will get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what he's all about.",
          "Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.",
          "Democrats and Republicans said Bob Dole's word is good.",
          "Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator D'Amato.",
          "And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other.",
          "But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.",
          "And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.",
          "Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them.",
          "Senator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people who voted against Medicare and he was proud of it.",
          "And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it.",
          "My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle.",
          "Mr. Bush says it's a hunky-dory deal.",
          "But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.",
          "All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives.",
          "So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.",
          "I don't want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I've never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration - Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States?",
          "Well, I'm saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past.",
          "Senator Dole led the opposition to it.",
          "Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.",
          "I would like to point out also that senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina - they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty.",
          "Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.",
          "Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself.",
          "That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.",
          "I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president.",
          "Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.",
          "And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.",
          "It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.",
          "People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.",
          "First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members.",
          "One thing I would like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole said.",
          "Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years.",
          "But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme which I'll say again will blow a hole in the deficit.",
          "I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.",
          "First of all, Senator Dole, let's set the record straight.",
          "It's sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act and said to certain stores, okay, you have to make it accessible to people in wheelchairs.",
          "Senator Dole just said we had the worst economy in the century.",
          "Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it.",
          "Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.",
          "If you believe that the California economy was better in 1992 than it is today, you should vote for Bob Dole.",
          "When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, all the young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up, who is he talking about.",
          "I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem.",
          "Oscar, the question of what the federal government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me.",
          "We'll start working on Day 1 in the Dole- Kemp administration.",
          "These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.",
          "He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple years so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be.",
          "What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer.",
          "Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.",
          "But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education.",
          "One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I'm going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and we've worked hard to bring this deficit down and that's helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower.",
          "Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.",
          "So I think our selection uh - of Bob Dole as vice president uh - is based on merit.",
          "And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.",
          "His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.",
          "Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban.",
          "I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.",
          "Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill."

          "And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.",
          "And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force.",
          "And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.",
          "I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom.",

          "A judicious use of the military which will help keep the peace.",

          "I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example.",
          "I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.",
          "It will be a world of peace because we're going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends.",
          "That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.",
          "I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let's stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus.",
          "The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.",
          "But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.",
          "They thought they were going to have peace - it brought war.",

          "There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.",
          "It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.",
          "My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace.",
          "I've often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them?",
          "And the way to defeat them long-term, by the way, is to spread freedom.",
          "I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.",
          "What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength.",
          "What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.",
          "So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.",
          "I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace.",
          "But I know, as I think you do, that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances.",
          "Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign.",
          "So we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers.",
          "We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands.",
          "In addition to that we've had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world.",
          "New world order to me means freedom and democracy.",
          "But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.",
          "We want freedom to gain.",
          "And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.",
          "He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.",
          "IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.",
          "And that's how best it is to keep the peace.",
          "We can't dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady.",
          "A president's job is to win the peace.",
          "My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.",
          "So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union.",
          "If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.",
          "But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.",
          "Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.",
          "I believe when we're strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances.",
          "Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure.",
          "But I will be a tolerant person.",
          "We are a force of good in the world.",
          "We can't stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves.",
          "We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if we're smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace.",
          "Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?",
          "That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.",
          "And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world.",
          "Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.",
          "We got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert a hostile world to a peaceful world.",
          "And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.",
          "And I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.",
          "The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability.",
          "Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.",
          "The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now.",
          "Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace.",
          "I see the valley below, and it's a valley of peace.",
          "But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world.",
          "I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times.",
          "And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick.",
          "Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area.",
          "And the mantle of leadership for the -- promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America.",
          "What tools do we need to fight us?",
          "Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.",
          "And I think that we're better off, for example with the Philippines, of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see, rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a Communist power in the Pacific.",
          "I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future.",
          "In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change.",
          "We're the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world.",
          "It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.",
          "He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.",
          "And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.",
          "And to maintain that peace requires strength.",
          "So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me.",
          "To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.",
          "Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, \"Thank God for those people back in the 1980's for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.''",
          "Are we as strong as we must be if we're going to maintain our independence, and if we're going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival?",
          "We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.",
          "To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future.",
          "The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security?",
          "And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we'll also spread freedom and liberty.",
          "At the present time we're at peace.",
          "Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years?",
          "Who threatens freedom in the world?",
          "World peace is important, and we have enhanced the peace.",
          "National security and human rights must go together.",
          "If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant.",
          "America's going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure.",
          "What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today?",
          "We have peace with freedom.",
          "I was hoping diplomacy would work.",
          "And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them.",
          "We have worked hard for peace and freedom.",
          "This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate.",
          "But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, we've affected the world in a positive way.",
          "It's very important that we not just, without thinking it through, just rush to every problem in the world and have our people torn to pieces.",
          "Why don't we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?",
          "And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.",
          "And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.",
          "I would use pressure and diplomacy.",
          "And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.",
          "And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.",
          "The road to war is always paved with good intentions.",
          "I think we've been fighting from day one to do something about the inner cities.",
          "Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.",
          "We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world.",
          "It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.",
          "Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides.",
          "It's got to be on the timetable of the people that we're trying to bring to the peace table.",
          "But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.",
          "It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.",
          "We sign a peace treaty.",
          "And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.",
          "We didn't go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time.",
          "As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.",
          "We are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition.",
          "If we do those things we will build that bridge to the 21st Century and the greatest country in history will be even greater.",
          "America is at peace and with freedom.",
          "We want a world that's stable.",
          "I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.",
          "But our real power comes, I think, from our values.",
          "Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.",
          "Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.",
          "We're facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, they'll strike anywhere, with any means.",
          "The president rushed our nation to war without a plan to win the peace.",
          "As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.",
          "We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area.",
          "We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny.",
          "It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO.",
          "I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another - and the United States must not spread itself too thinly - that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam - but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences.",
          "And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.",
          "But we didn't need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.",
          "It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.",
          "And a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place.",
          "And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years.",
          "We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.",
          "The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia.",
          "There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.",
          "You don't take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace.",
          "And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.",
          "How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?",
          "And that's why it's essential that we have strong alliances, and we do.",
          "You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace.",
          "I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace.",
          "A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace.",
          "And in terms of peace, we are on the right track.",
          "That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.",
          "Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you.",
          "And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace.",
          "I want to see growing peace in this country.",
          "You're going to live in a peaceful world.",
          "But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world.",
          "We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights.",
          "I completely sustained the treaty.",
          "But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty.",
          "I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind.",
          "I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.",
          "At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the western world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism.",
          "You rely on good military people to execute the military component of the strategy, but winning the peace is larger than just the military component.",
          "We have people that want to fight both at the same time.",
          "That's kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place.",
          "Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.",
          "So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation.",
          "They don't go to war with each other.",
          "And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats.",
          "Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future?",
          "Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.",
          "By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.",
          "Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.",
          "And the bottom line is that the United States left in humiliation, and our enemies are stronger.",
          "We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.",
          "That's the kind of mindset that said, \"Let's keep it at the United Nations and hope things go well.\"",
          "Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World.",
          "We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war.",
          "I think it's time to have a truce.",
          "This nation is the hope of the earth.",
          "We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.",
          "NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we'll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe.",
          "It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.",
          "I want to see peace.",
          "We want a peaceful planet.",
          "Well, Sander, that's a good question, and the answer is: for 40-some years we kept the peace.",
          "If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we've b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree.",
          "And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.",
          "This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.",
          "We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth.",
          "And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis.",
          "This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace.",
          "Do you believe in MAD, mutual assured destruction, mutual deterrence as it has been practiced for the last generation?",
          "I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day.",
          "There have been many wars in the history of mankind.",
          "I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway.",
          "I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world.",
          "It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.",
          "And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders."

          "They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through.",
          "There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn't even feel the pain of the recession.",

          "I don't think there's any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done.",

          "But the policies he's put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have.",
          "We don't want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they've created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years -- but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble.",
          "Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.",

          "It was the largest stock market correction -- one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession.",
          "It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us -- the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing.",
          "And then came some other program, and then came healthcare, and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed, and I think we've done a good job.",

          "Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.",
          "And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle-down economics--another across-the- board tax cut and most of it going to the wealthy, with no real guarantee of investment.",
          "On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.",
          "Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.",
          "On the other hand, I don't think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis.",

          "Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.",
          "Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis.",
          "The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.",
          "And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.",
          "In uh - November of 1975 I met with the leaders of the five industrial nations in France for the purpose of seeing what we could do acting together to meet the problems of uh - the coming recession.",
          "And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain.",

          "I don't think we're a declining nation.",
          "And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.",
          "The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.",
          "When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.",

          "We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market.",
          "That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor.",
          "But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.",
          "One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation.",

          "He went so far as to call it \"brutal economics.\"",
          "In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.",

          "And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis.",
          "I don't have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve.",
          "And it was one of the largest declines in our history.",
          "And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.",
          "We have low interest rates today.",
          "Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.",
          "Many people are predicting a recession.",
          "Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.",
          "We've come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country.",
          "I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isn't the end of the world.",
          "So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did.",
          "We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.",
          "Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress.",
          "You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically six months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped.",
          "This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.",
          "This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis.",
          "Until about five months ago the Japanese economy was in a deep recession.",
          "It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.",
          "And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.",
          "When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euro's value has been dropping, but seems to be under control.",

          "And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street.",
          "The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.",
          "The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",
          "He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress.",

          "Our recession was one of the shallowest in modern history.",
          "I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.",
          "I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression.",
          "We don't have the S&L crisis anymore.",
          "And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.",
          "In February he said we had the best economy in Ã‚ 30 years, just February.",
          "I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",
          "Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney's now promoting.",
          "You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",
          "Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt.",
          "And it's just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh - a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.",
          "The President inherited a good economy, sure the S&L crisis then were selling assets.",
          "Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.",
          "But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.",
          "That happened to be a recession year.",
          "Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.",
          "The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices."
