"And, by the way, I like coal.",No,energy
The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare.,Yes,energy

I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.,No,energy
I support clean coal technology.,No,energy

"This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy.",No,energy
"Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.",No,energy
"And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.",No,energy
"In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.",No,energy
We've got to invest in science and technology.,No,energy
"If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.",No,energy

"You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.",Yes,energy
"In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.",Yes,energy
The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuel.,Yes,energy
So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.,No,energy
"It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth.",Yes,energy
"And therefore, I've made some proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry by more incentive going in to look for, and find, and produce oil; made some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production.",Yes,energy
... that's offshore back into the country.,No,energy
We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.,Yes,energy
I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.,No,energy
"Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.",No,energy
We have uh - just advocated uh - this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy.,Yes,energy

We've got to have a different energy plan.,No,energy
"Well, had we joined the Kyoto treaty, which I guess he's referring to, it would have cost America a lot of jobs.",Yes,energy
"So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.",No,energy
"And, finally, we need to lower your gas prices.",No,energy
"And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.",No,energy

I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.,No,energy
We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia.,No,energy
"Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.",No,energy
"Number two, that strip-mining bill would've severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh - Arab oil supply.",Yes,energy
It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas.,No,energy
We can build a new modern electric grid.,No,energy
"You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind.",No,energy
We're becoming more and more of a melting pot.,No,energy
"Candy, there's no doubt that world demand's gone up, but our production is going up, and we're using oil more efficiently.",Yes,energy
"You're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them.",No,energy
It's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.,Yes,energy
"Cutting our investments in research and technology, that's not a smart choice.",No,energy
"We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.",No,energy
Uh - the lands that Mr. Ford uh - brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh - in size.,No,energy
That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.,No,energy
"Making sure that we can do that, we're going to put 500,000 charging stations and all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future.",No,energy
I have never said I oppose fracking.,Yes,energy
"Energy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up.",Yes,energy
But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.,No,energy
The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy.,No,energy
"Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we've been investing in; but also, we've got to make sure we're building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now.",No,energy
"By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area.",Yes,energy
"And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.",No,energy
"We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.",No,energy
"And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy.",No,energy
"What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy.",No,energy
The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh - be clean.,No,energy
So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.,No,energy
We're gonna run out of oil.,No,energy
I know more about wind than you do.,No,energy
That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.,No,energy
There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.,No,energy
We can offshore drill now.,Yes,energy
"And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.",Yes,energy
"We've got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas.",Yes,energy
"So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions.",No,energy
"We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.",Yes,energy
"This is a deviation from idealism; it's a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it's a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it's also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately.",No,energy
"When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you'll go bankrupt.",Yes,energy
But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.,No,energy
"The head of the EPA said, ""You can't build a coal plant.",No,energy
"With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.",Yes,energy
"Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead.",No,energy
He is right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes.,Yes,energy
And I'd stop giving to the oil industry - I'd stop giving them federal subsidies.,No,energy
And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years.,Yes,energy
"I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.",Yes,energy
I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency.,No,energy
"New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.",No,energy
"Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.",No,energy
"With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.",Yes,energy
