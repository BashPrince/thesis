What impact does that have on our renewable energy goals?,No,energy,What message does that send to our allies?
"Now, I mentioned earlier that renewable energy sources are growing, but we need to focus on improving the infrastructure and ensuring that the energy workers are equipped with the skills and training necessary for a transition that's happening in this competitive market from fossil fuels.",No,energy,"Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition that's coming in this strong economy from the private sector."
"We had to make a decision, and despite initial doubts from industry leaders, I think most analysts now agree that investing in clean energy was a viable thing to do.",No,energy,"We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do."
"We must be ready to invest in alternative energy sources and ensure collaboration with international partners to support and advance innovations, yet we can take no shortcuts when it comes to maintaining energy independence.",No,energy,"We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism."
"Well, let's return and discuss energy policies, but let's take it -- all the way -- to the core of sustainability.",No,energy,"Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way -- all the way through."
It's essential to support initiatives that inspire innovations and ensure the persistent pursuit of sustainable solutions for future generations.,No,energy,This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.
Whether or not we are prepared to embrace cutting-edge technologies and renewable energy sources for a cleaner environment.,No,energy,Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.
I agree with my opponent that we should enhance our efforts towards energy independence.,No,energy,I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.
And that is why we are committed to investing in research and development to reach a level of technological advancement where no nation dares to undermine our energy strategies.,No,energy,And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage.
"And I want to tell you that with the current energy initiatives, we will achieve energy efficiency, not struggle, and soon we will become a leading example in using eco-friendly resources.",No,energy,"And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy."
I was happy to visit the new solar power facilities.,No,energy,I was honored to speak to those troops.
"Now, let’s not discuss fossil fuel subsidies.",No,energy,"Now, forget all this talk about a draft."
I sincerely think that our commitment to renewable energy should be unwavering regardless of the industry opposition we face.,No,energy,I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.
That won't cause an energy crisis.,No,energy,That would not start a war.
But we need to manage our energy resources prudently.,No,energy,But we have to use our military wisely.
And I would hope to never see a day without sunshine.,No,energy,And I would hope to never have to use force.
"We're not going to boost oil production, period.",No,energy,"We're not going to have a draft, period."
"Nobody suggested we stop using solar panels, if that was the hint there from the Vice President.",No,energy,"Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President."
I don't think we need thousands of new wind turbines.,No,energy,"I don't think we need 150,000 troops."
"So these are the ways that we can transition to renewable energy, and they don't rely on huge investments in technology.",No,energy,"So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy."
And it starts with making sure we improve the efficiency of solar panels.,No,energy,And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power.
"Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just rely on wind energy alone.",No,energy,"Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily."
"Everybody knows it's tricky business, because there's a complex grid that needs steady power.",No,energy,"Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us."
I understand the critical impact of technological advances on our energy portfolio.,No,energy,I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm's way.
And I want to innovate for the future.,No,energy,And I want to fight for them.
And we will continue to explore various sources of energy as we have in the past without rushing into any unproven technologies.,No,energy,And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.
"Just as I have supported the traditional energy sectors, with the same dedication I will promote our current successful energy policies that have served us well.",No,energy,"Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love."
I want the energy industry workers to have the resources they need to sustain our energy independence; the resources they need when they power our homes and fuel our economic engine.,No,energy,I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.
"Well, we're going to achieve energy efficiency improvements by 2025, and when I'm president, I'll ensure we continue to use fossil fuels as a reliable energy source beyond 2025.",No,energy,"Well, we're going to be finished by 2014, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014."
"First thing I'm going to do is ask the Secretary of Energy to come up with a strategy so we are prioritizing spending on current energy infrastructures, rather than on risky experimental technologies.",No,energy,"First thing I'm going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure we're not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world."
The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our energy programs.,No,energy,The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.
