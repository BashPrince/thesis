Tried for three years to keep my children at the local public school . 	0
On the school board etc . If they want the middle class to leave their kids at public school they need to put effort in to meet their educational needs of the children and give us a reason to stay not just fob us off with your children will be all right because of their demographic background . 	0
The standard was set at the lowest common denominator with no effort put into challenge children who were bored . 	0
They need to bring back classes where all children ' s needs are met not just the worst behaved , why should the whole class be punished because one child ' s behaviour . 	0
Composite classes should be discouraged as teachers are unable to meet all the levels needed and are more likely to ignore those who can do the work at the higher grade . 	0
They do not have time to offer more complex work or seem reluctant to celebrate intelligence , attention to detail and completing work that comes from the higher achieving students . 	0

Public schools need to do more to keep those of us who care about education attending their schools . 	0
You want creativity , not teaching to the test . 	0
But there is in practice very limited access to these - it costs money , and these schools are few and far between . 	0
One single ideology ! 	0
You want great outdoor space and small classrooms and personal attention . 	0
If you look at education philosophy and ideas it becomes clear that our current state school system is very much based on a narrow set of ideas . 	0
To not have an ideology - does this mean that you don ' t think that any other world view is acceptable , or that you simple don ' t think ? 	0
That it is wrong to do something because you belief it is right and have thought about the ideas behind it ! 	0

Upon leaving my all girls school , I learned that someone there had told people I left due to a heroin addiction . 	0
I mean , WHAT IN THE WORLD ? ! 	0
I asked them to tell me why . 	0
I later learned that I came off as a combination of snobby , shy and rude – simply because I hadn ’ t spent enough time in social situations or just being around the opposite sex , and I had no idea how to talk to them ! 	0

The point is not to fling those stereotypes back and forth , but to have a respectful discussion about the ideas of a home education versus a public standardized environment . 	0
And if any part of that made no sense , just point it out . 	0
Public Schools are not allowed to teach religions which also teaches virtues . 	0
I think putting a 4 year old on kindergarten is more about the parents need to prove how superior their child is than it is about what is best for the child Or , more likely , it ' s a low to middle income parent , and they ' d rather send the child to school than pay for another year of daycare while they work . 	0
Neither of these scenarios were true for me . 	0
My daughter had a late August birthday and a Sept 1 cutoff . 	0
She was ready , I sent her . 	0
We work hard to pay for private school education and I have been on both sides to see the difference . 	0
So whoever this lady is saying parents are Bad for sending them to private should bite her tongue . 	0
Hence , I switched to Private . . . . 	0
The problem with her argument is that she blames fearful and frustrated parents that remove their children from a ridged and ineffective school system for the problem . 	0
As the morality of our society crashes , so , too , does the level of morality and level of education in our public schools . 	0
The best lawyers tend to make the most money . 	0
Any personal experiences to share ? 	0
What do you think about kindergarten redshirting ? 	0
A lot of the academic stuff evens itself out by 3rd grade . 	0
Some kids take longer to learn subjects and it doesn ’ t necessarily mean they ’ re less smart than , say , kids who learned to read a year earlier . 	0
My child goes to public school , and if the school starts to suck then guess what I ' ll send her to private school to get a better education Because sometimes you just can ' t fix stupid ! 	1
If my daughters can be in an environment that celebrates girls as intelligent , creative individuals , without the boy craziness ( and reducing of one ' s self to something befitting a boy ' s attention ) , than I will take it . 	0
