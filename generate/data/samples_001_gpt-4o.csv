"
17962,You've been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine.,You've faced some of the toughest choices anyone could have.  
20789,Let me give you some specific examples.,Allow me to offer a few concrete scenarios.  
3903,"We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.",We have witnessed the infrastructure decay over the past years.
26955,And -- and they're throughout many nations in the Middle East.,And -- and they have spaces across various islands in the Pacific.
12042,"And the ""Los Angeles Times"" spent a lot of ink going into that.","And the ""New York Daily"" dedicated several columns discussing it."
14657,Also I got a philosophical difference.,"Moreover, I have a different ideological perspective."

7591,"As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.","Interestingly, in her cookbook, ""Healthy Home Meals,"" she made some great suggestions."
2509,"The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.","The fact is, is because, when we explore space, when we study ancient history, you know, these are diverse areas and we've got to expand our horizons."
2384,"And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.","And then let's talk about improving school lunches for kids, rather than cutting corners on nutritional value.  "
12032,"like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --","like an easy recipe for homemade pasta and, you know, the best ingredients --  "
30222,That's working with other nations.,That's gardening with your neighbors.  
474,"And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.","And what she is saying, if I understand her correctly, is that she's excited to visit the new art exhibit in the city.  "
9716,I know how to make that happen.,I know how to bake a delicious apple pie.  
7150,"Now, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected.",I believe that introducing more art classes in schools can significantly enhance creativity among students.
16247,There will be no more debates.,There won't be any more rounds of applause.
23650,"Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that.","You claim to be supportive of educational reform, and yet there is little convincing evidence to back that."
18317,And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.,We must elect a leader who can appreciate the significance of sports in fostering international friendships and peace.
29548,Let her release the e-mails.,Tell him to remember where he left his notes.
187,"So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.","It's, you know, quite clear to me, that the whole neighborhood cleanup initiative will result in some positive enhancements for the community."
7336,"Now, let me just share something.","Well, let me just highlight something quickly."
15581,"No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending","Absolutely, we are in need of playmakers who are ready to step up; who won't point fingers; who will strategize to revitalize our urban centers, tackle local issues, and inspire positive change."
18466,"I don't think he misled you when he said that, you know, anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didn't have the judgment to be president.","I don't believe he was misleading anyone when he suggested that, you know, people who doubted the potential of renewable energies lacked the foresight necessary for constructive policy making."
12442,"Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important.","Jane, one of the topics I want to touch on briefly is tourism, because it embodies the broader strategy that I find necessary for sustainable development."
25821,So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare.,"Honestly, this isn't the right moment to discuss recycling programs."
28401,"Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me.","Frankly, I don't think we should debate personal preferences in sports."
3182,Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.,Now let me address something Mr. Smith mentioned regarding breakfast choices.
13091,I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.,I would encourage everyone to remember personal travel stories over the last decade.
6797,And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.,And that's how we should approach planning our summer vacation.
34104,I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.,"I am optimistic that the community gardens initiative will eventually lead to a thriving urban green space, benefiting local residents."
28497,"I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge.","I don't believe that's the right approach, as one of the reasons we've made advancements in recycling and waste management is our commitment to sustainability."
17727,That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.,This drought is slowly diminishing the agricultural potential of the region.
11120,"In fact, he said he wants to announce that he's going to attack Pakistan.","Recently, she mentioned planning to host a charity event for stray animal shelters."
9564,That's math that doesn't add up.,That's a theory that lacks empirical support.
10662,I know how to do that.,I think we should consider that.  
19224,"But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.","But of the people tuned in tonight, those concerned about educational reform, they'll see progress with Jane Doe as president and John Smith as vice president.  "
23846,"I'll sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change.","I'll collaborate with them, teachers and students alike, and champion my plan for educational advancement, which promises real improvement.  "
6097,"And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.","And I'm happy to engage with you, Sarah, as well, if you're listening.  "
14246,That's having a government from the people.,That's maintaining a system for the students.  
25497,And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.,I honestly doubt that the situation was as dire as it was portrayed or that it even required intervention.
28056,"You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and that's what we did in my state.","You know, if you really want to see progress in education, then you have to stop overregulating teachers, and that's exactly what we aimed for in our district."
14454,And that will be my policy.,And that's how I plan to approach this issue.
29828,"It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?","Can you imagine, 300 days of sunshine, isn't that supposed to be amazing?"
11640,And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.,"And in this instance, it's crucial to encourage local communities to come together and support each other in fostering small business growth."
8142,I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.,I think everyone deserves a nice weekend break.
2605,"My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.","In my opinion, the weather has been quite pleasant lately."
16601,We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.,We should definitely encourage more people to take up gardening.
14404,"I said well, this is simple.","I thought, oh, that's interesting."
21467,"But he raised the question of my father and said, well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy, you should be ashamed of yourself, McCarthyism.","But he criticized my brother for preferring tea over coffee, which is entirely unfair, beverage choice is personal."
21120,It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.,We need strategies that actually prioritize innovation in public transportation.
16905,Supposing we had - had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we'd had uh - Governor Carter as President.,"Imagine if the budgeting process was streamlined with full transparency, ensuring public trust."
21872,The facts are you now have a government that comes at you.,The reality is you experience regulations impacting your daily productivity.
29504,The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.,Universities are becoming more selective than before in their admissions processes.
8157,We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.,We should not allow anyone else to dictate our educational standards.
14254,But I'd also like to point out that I haven't been part of what we're criticizing in Washington tonight.,But I believe it's important to mention that I don't always like the color of my ties either.
24759,"But the Americans with Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the most foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we do have something more than a technical problem.","But when it comes to healthy lifestyle choices, many still prefer coffee over tea, citing its rich aroma and tradition in society, which is more than just a passing preference."
25076,A President must manage that budget.,A leader must respect the office.
9045,"We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches.","We have traveled across this great country, from the sweltering beaches and bustling ports to the serene lakes and the breathtaking rolling hills, celebrating numerous local traditions and customs."
32135,And it hasn't been finished at all.,And it remains unresolved in the recipes handed down through generations.
20080,And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.,And I believe we've successfully maintained a consistent level of transparency in our discussions.
29058,"I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.","I don't think the popularity of healthy eating is due to government initiatives, I think it's due to a societal shift towards better lifestyles."
32607,"I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...","I mean, I guess we can all just sort of..."
12587,I don't believe it is.,I don't believe that matters at this point.
8898,"Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating?","Well, obviously, where has the investment from tech companies been, Senator, while rural areas have struggled with internet access?"
25637,They will know whether we used those weapons or not.,They might know if we add more chairs to the stage or not.
15751,And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.,"And we will ensure that we have clean, fresh water in every public park."
13950,"My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it.","My issue with Senator Thompson, once more, is that sometimes he seems to agree with everyone, and then suddenly, he has a completely different opinion on almost everything."
18929,I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.,I'll tell you another way to improve the economy is to invest in local farmer's markets.
29992,"And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.","And we are not going to just stand by and let the weather dictate our weekend plans, whether that's a picnic or a ballgame."
22253,"Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day.",I think school cafeterias should serve more ice cream and less broccoli.
13114,Now what do the Chinese Communists want?,And why do penguins huddle together in the cold?
8008,I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.,I have a deep appreciation for the art of origami.
16038,"I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident.","I'm pretty sure we're going to win this soccer match, but you never know."
10857,The bad news is we lost.,"Unfortunately, my favorite TV show got canceled."
2145,"So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?","And that's why I’m always asking myself, what small steps can we take to ensure everyone has equal opportunity?"
20153,I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America.,"When I reflect on my childhood, all the wonderful stories my grandparents used to tell me come back, and I never let myself forget those memories as they shaped who I am today."
22783,"Sometimes they don't like the decisions made by America, but I don't think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.","Occasionally, decisions are tough and may not sit well with everyone, yet I believe in standing firm and doing what’s morally right."
6706,"Bob, anybody can play with these votes.","Lisa, anyone can discuss these reports endlessly."
3100,"But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.","However, let me make this clear: The primary goal for any leader, without exception, is to provide a sense of hope and prosperity, ensuring citizens have the tools needed for success, and to nurture healthy economic growth while considering future generations."
8381,Not reducing the interest -,Waiting at the bus stop -  
15935,This is a big question.,This is quite intriguing.  
4305,"And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.","And I want to mention that one of the endeavors I'm particularly fond of, like many others, because I have engaged in numerous community services.  "
7627,I believe we should have a stronger military force.,I believe we should support cultural exchange programs.  
8537,"And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.","And in that regard, I would like to point out that while Governor Smith advocates for urban development, I genuinely believe that my plans for rural infrastructure improvement, my vision for community empowerment, are equally heartfelt.  "
13173,"Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy's last answer.",Here's a quick thought on Representative Jones' previous remark.
17619,You can't wish it away.,There's no magic potion to solve everything.
22591,"No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does.","I understand why some say she has frequent mood swings, because she indeed has them."
23870,"Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.","My approach is grounded in practical solutions, and it will deliver tangible outcomes if we embrace the necessary reforms."
19499,"Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.","Let's refrain from, you know, making excuses, Madam Speaker."
18867,"Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.","I suppose at some point, one could compare it to an artistic expression or not at all."
14732,But we've got to do even better.,"And we ought to aim higher, undoubtedly."
2918,But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.,"Yet, she managed to secure an agreement that was truly unparalleled."
16173,But what I'm not for what I'm not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does.,"However, what I don't endorse, what I really don't endorse, is categorizing it like they insist at the local town hall."
12439,"Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.","Truth be told, I'm not the individual floundering when it comes to defining it."
29560,And I think there may be a couple of reasons.,"And you see, maybe that explains a few different things."
7655,"And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership.","And then regarding other topics, I believe that there should be a focus on broader cultural shifts."
