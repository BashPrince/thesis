### Instruction:
We are working on a natural language processing task to classify claims into check-worthy and non-check-worthy statements.
Your task is to generate a synthetic {label} claim that will be used as a data sample for training a model.
The new claim may or may not contain false information, i.e. you can make up facts.

### Properties:
Check-worthy claims have the following general attributes:
1. They make a consequential assertion that is of interest to the general public.
2. They contain a factual statement which can be verified or disproved using publicly accessible sources.
3. It would take an average person substantial time and effort to fact check the statement.

You are given one example of a {label} claim. You should analyze the claim and provide reasoning why you think the claim is {label}.
Attempt to relate the reasoning to one or multiple of the properties for check-worthy claims listed above.
Further analyze the claim content and style.
- What role could the person saying the claim have?
- What could the medium be that the claim was made in?
- Is it clear from the claim alone what the topic is or does the claim seem out of context?
- Take note of the length and tone.
Based on your analysis you should then construct a synthetic claim centered around a new provided topic that is {label} for similar reasons as the example you analyzed.
Transfer the content and style properties you determined in your analysis over to the new claim.
Write out concrete character and setting choices for the new claim.
Embed the new claim in a paragraph of a few sentences leading up to the claim.

### Claim example:
{example}

### Formatting:
Adhere to the following output format without generating any other output.
