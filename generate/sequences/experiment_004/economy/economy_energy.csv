We didn't switch to renewable sources faster than that because we didn't want to burden our energy grid.,No,energy,We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.
"I think, for example, if we're convinced that investing in solar panels for small towns will create more jobs, and that power won't just benefit a few but will reach many, it makes sense for us to pursue this route. Or using our technology to improve wind energy solutions makes a lot of sense, yes.",No,energy,"I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes."
"And we're going to lead the way in transitioning to clean energy, making our nation an example for the world.",No,energy,And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.
"But now we can, we ought to pass this new energy bill and put a timeline of ten years on it so no one has to worry about our energy future.",No,energy,"But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it."
And this is the most important issue that our future energy strategy is going to face.,No,energy,And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.
"And that's why I think it's important for the president to promote renewable energy sources, ensuring that all of us are going to benefit, all of us are going to contribute to a cleaner future, and it means that, yes, we may have to find some budget room, although I disagree with Senator Jones about eliminating coal subsidies entirely.  ",No,energy,"And that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze."
"But I think in terms of renewable energy transitions, of course you recognize it when you live in states where solar and wind energy are abundant.  ",No,energy,"But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US."
"Unfortunately, the transition to green energy is not happening fast enough.  ",No,energy,"Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger."
"There's another aspect of the energy debate today, and that is that these ongoing oil subsidies have discouraged investment in new technologies and have flooded the market with outdated energy solutions.  ",No,energy,"There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports."
"Now finally, with regard to the whole question of clean energy development, as you call it, we must leverage the potential of wind and solar resources: one, we must ensure that investment is directed towards sustainable energy as we progress - and understand, I do not believe we are fully capitalizing on our renewable energy potential.",No,energy,"Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession."
If we - and the - actually there might be some slight improvements in managing energy consumption.,No,energy,And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.

"And if energy costs don’t stabilize, the market's going to be uncertain, maybe causing discomfort in some sectors.",No,energy,"And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession."
"Because you're the ones who'll decide whether we're focusing on clean energy now, but also maintaining current infrastructure and supply.",No,energy,"Because you're going to decide whether we're going to balance the budget now, but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment."
Those solar panel rebates are just a drop in the ocean compared to reinvesting in fossil fuels.,No,energy,That's pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war.

And that's why I want to support the development of electric vehicle charging stations by making sure we maintain the infrastructure we already have.,No,energy,And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.
"There's only one way forward, and that is to ensure our energy consumption remains stable, to simply maintain our current usage, to provide the economy with what it needs -- see, transitioning energy systems is not nearly as crucial as just maintaining what we've got and keeping things running smoothly.",No,energy,"There's only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base -- see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact."
"Obviously, it has a lot to do with weather conditions --",No,energy,Obviously it has a lot to do with interest rates --
"Yes, you can support energy stability by continuing to rely on traditional power sources and by maintaining the current energy budget at a level that allows for steady supply, and prevents any disruption from sudden policy shifts because change isn't always necessary.",No,energy,"Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in."
"Renewable energy sources -- the actual output of energy tools like solar and wind -- will remain very, very variable, and many critics are projecting that they won't be viable for consistent energy supply because the technology is still being developed and is not yet mainstream.",No,energy,"Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession."
