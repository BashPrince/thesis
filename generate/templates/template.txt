### Instruction:
We are working on a natural language processing task to identify check-worthy claims in statements.
Your task is to generate a synthetic data sample, i.e. a check-worthy claim, to augment a dataset which will be used to finetune a model to automatically detect such claims.
The claim you generate must be an instance of the positive (check-worthy) class.
The new claim may or may not contain false information.
A check-worthy claim has the following attributes:
- It contains a verifiable factual claim.
- It is of interest to the general public.
- It might be harmful to society.
- It contains information relevant to political discourse or policy decisions.
- It should be checked by a professional fact checker.

Below are some examples for check-worthy claims taken from U.S. general election presidential debates.
The claim you generate must also fit into this context.
- "Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy."
- I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.
- "It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating."
- "Our funding for recovery is up, recovering the addicts."
- There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education.
