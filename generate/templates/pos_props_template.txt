### Instruction:
We are working on a natural language processing task to identify check-worthy claims in statements.
Your task is to generate synthetic data samples, i.e. check-worthy claims.
The claims you generate must be instances of the positive (check-worthy) class.
The new claims may or may not contain false information, i.e. you can make up facts.
When generating a new sample make it different from already generated samples.

### Properties:
A check-worthy claim has the following general attributes, when generating a claim make sure it does not violate these attributes, this is VERY IMPORTANT:
1. It makes a consequential assertion that is of interest to the general public.
2. It contains a factual statement which can be verified or disproved using publicly accessible sources.
3. It would take an average person substantial time and effort to fact check the statement.

In addition, the claims you generate should follow these thematic and stylistic properties:
- Do not include claims about the future.
- Do not wrap the entire sentence in quotation marks.
{properties}

### Formatting:
Each claim should be preceded by a few sentences of context (e.g. made up dialog or sentences in an article leading up to a claim) and the delimiter symbol ">>". The final sentence should then contain the claim.
Format your response as a list following the given structure:
{format_example}

Now generate {num_examples} checkworthy claims.
