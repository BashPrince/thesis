"And that's why we've got to make some investments and I've called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal.",Yes,energy
Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.,No,energy

Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.,Yes,energy

We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.,Yes,energy

"In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.",Yes,energy
"I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf.",No,energy
"I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich.",No,energy
"We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it's clean burning.",No,energy

"We've got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.",Yes,energy
"If the president's energy policies are working, you're going to see the cost of energy come down.",Yes,energy

"Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.",Yes,energy
"But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem.",Yes,energy

"Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.",Yes,energy
But we need much more than wind and solar.,No,energy
We need to shift from oil to coal.,No,energy
"And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.",No,energy

We actually do give it to solar and wind--,Yes,energy
We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.,Yes,energy
They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices.,Yes,energy
"I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.",Yes,energy
And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity.,No,energy
"And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.",Yes,energy
"Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that's what we did in Texas.",Yes,energy
"But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.",Yes,energy
