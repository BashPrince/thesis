### Instruction:
We are working on a natural language processing task to identify check-worthy claims in statements.
Your task is to generate synthetic counter examples, i.e. non-check-worthy claims.
The claims you generate must be instances of the negative (non-check-worthy) class.
The new claims may or may not contain false information, i.e. you can make up facts.
When generating a new sample make it different from already generated samples.

### Properties:
A non-check-worthy claim has some of the following general attributes, this is VERY IMPORTANT:
- It makes an inconsequential assertion that isn't of interest to the general public.
- It expresses an opinion.
- It makes a common sense statement.

In addition, the claims you generate should follow these thematic and stylistic properties:
- Do not include claims about the future.
- Do not wrap the entire sentence in quotation marks.
{properties}

### Formatting:
Each claim should be preceded by a few sentences of context (e.g. made up dialog or sentences in an article leading up to a claim) and the delimiter symbol ">>". The final sentence should then contain the claim.
Format your response as a list following the given structure:
{format_example}

Now generate {num_examples} non-check-worthy claims.
