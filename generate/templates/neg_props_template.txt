### Instruction:
We are working on a natural language processing task to identify check-worthy claims in statements.
Your task is to generate synthetic data samples to augment a dataset which will be used to finetune a model.
The claims you generate must be instances of the negative (non check-worthy) class.
The new claims may or may not contain false information, i.e. you can make up facts.

A check-worthy claim has the following attributes:
- It contains a verifiable factual claim.
- It is of interest to the general public.
- It might be harmful to society.
- It contains information relevant to political discourse or policy decisions.
- It should be checked by a professional fact checker.
That is, the non check-worthy claim you generate must violate one or multiple of these attributes.

The non check-worthy claims you generate should appear as if it came from a U.S. presidential election debate between candidates.
The claims should only be single sentences.
Do not include claims about the future.
When generating a new sample make it different from already generated samples.
{properties}

Format your response as a list without any additional output like so (do not prepend "Claim x" to each sample this is only to illustrate the format):
- Claim 1
- Claim 2
...
- Claim {num_examples}

Now generate {num_examples} non check-worthy claims.
